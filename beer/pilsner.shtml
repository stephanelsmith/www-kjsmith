It is 12 years since I first visited Quito in Ecuador.  On that first visit I enjoyed the local beer but did not take any labels.  It was only later, in Bolivia that I had the idea to collect labels off the bottles I drank.  Now, much later I again have had the opportunity to work on, and visit, Ecuador.  Here is the label for Cerveza Pilsener, a fine brew which satisfied me both in Quito and in the Amazon while conducting my geological investigations.
