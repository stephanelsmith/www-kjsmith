My collecting of beer labels truly begins in Africa with visits to the Congo.  There in that tropical climate with plenty of humidity and poor glue, the beer labels quickly slid off into one's hands while enjoying a cold brew.  I took a few without thinking and quickly found myself with an interesting set of tropical labels.  Add to this a few visits to Ecuador and the same thing, soon the collecting bug was in me.<p>
