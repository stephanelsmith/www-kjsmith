Flying to China from anywhere in the US is a long and tiring endavor.  After checking into our Beijing hotel my colligue Gert-Jan and I were hankering for a cold beer.  We walked out of the hotel onto the dark streets in search of a watering hole.  The district was pretty dead but after a couple turns and some persistance we found a small quiet bar which accepted our dollars and sat to have a couple Tigers.  To my suprise, the beer was not brewed in China but rather in Singapore.  It was good stuff, but I resolved to be more attentive and drink only chinese beers afterwards.
