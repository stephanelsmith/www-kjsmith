Live from Bucharest, Romania, brought to you by Bucharest's Gabriela Lincá and our own Bryan Lastraps its Ursus Beer!<p>
This page finally is as much about a collection of facinating and fun stories of beer label collecting (and beer drinking) as it is of the beer labels themselves.  This great label was collected by my friend and colligue Bryan while decompressing at the English Bar / Athenee Palace, in the Bucharest Hilton, on business...of course.  The label itself was difficult and basically impossible to remove, but my man, not a team leader for nothing, managed to get the capable and pleasant help of Ms Gabriela who was working the bar that evening.  In the course of convincing her of the worthiness of the cause he assured her that I would make her name a presence on the Worle Wide Web.  For me that naturally goes without saying..  This web, this collection finally is a human enterprise and it is the personalities that count most.  So, my sincere thanks to Bryan and to Gabriela for their efforts on behalf of my page.  And to you personally Gabriela, nice to meet you!<br>
