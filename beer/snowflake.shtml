Brewed, (I believe) in Shenyang, Snowflake beer refreshed me while staying in the town of Huadian, China.  I was doing field work and the days were warm and dusty so when the evenings arrived, fresh beer was a real pleasure!<p>
With a dry climate and good glues, I was generally unable to remove labels from the bottle I drank.  At the request of our Shell China hosts most of the labels were removed by the waitresses in whatever resturant we happened to be.  As they see few, if any, westerners in many of the places we visited, the request was usually viewed with considerable amusement on the part of the waitresses.
