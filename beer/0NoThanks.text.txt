Thank you for your note and your interest in my beer label page.  I am not really an active beer label collector as the majority of the labels presented are ones that I have acquired on trips myself.  They form a unique kind of souvenir quite unlike the "made for tourists" tickytac found in most shops.  In the process I have occasionally taken two or more labels and thus a few "spares".  These extra labels were long ago traded to interested collectors and the exchanged labels I have also placed on my page.  Finally, a few friends who know about my page have occasionally given me a label or two from places they have visited.

In any case, I am not really a collector in the strictest sense and do not have labels other than the actual ones you see scanned.  I am sorry but these scanned labels are special to me because of the trips I made and are not for trade.  Again, thank you for your interest.
