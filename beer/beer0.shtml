I enjoy a good brew as much as the next person, and I am an inveterate collector of things.  It should come as no suprise therefor that over the years and on my travels, I have collected together a small number of interesting labels of beers I have enjoyed.  Labels make an interesting item as each one seeks to attract and please the potential customer.  The designs are complete and compact.  Naturally, each label comes with its own memory, its little souvenir of times spent in the comradery of friends, of stories heard and told.<br>
The following labels each represent some moment, some story.  If you enjoy the set and would like to contribute, making this a collaborative effort then by all means email to me a scan of your label along with a short paragraph about the beer or a moment when it was enjoyed.  cheers!<p>

I would love to hear from you if you have comments or questions.  Please write me at the following:  <IMG SRC="kjadd.jpg">

A philosophical STATEMENT concerning BEER:<p>
A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of him. <p>

When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2" in diameter. He then asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. The students laughed and agreed that now it was. The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar.  Of course, the sand filled up everything else.  <p>

"Now," said the professor, "I want you to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full.  The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your car.  <p>

The sand is everything else, the small stuff. If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.  Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take your partner out dancing.  <p>

There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal. Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand."<p>

But then. A student stepped up to the desk and took the jar which the other students and the professor had agreed was full.  He removed a bottle of beer from his pack, opening it he proceeded to pour it into the jar. Of course the beer filled the remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full. <p>

The moral of this tale is: No matter how full your life is, there is always room for BEER!<p>

About the background:<br>
Not a beer label at all, this is from a bottle of Boualem and Son's Lemonaid from Algeria.  This lemonaid is like nothing you have ever had and is one of the most wonderful drinks I have ever tasted.  It is increasingly difficult to obtain even in Algiers and also subject to rip-off copies.  It is a shame to see such a quality product pass quietly away.
