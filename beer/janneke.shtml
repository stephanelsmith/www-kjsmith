I received the other day a pleasant suprise gift from my dutch friend and colligue Gé Van Opstal.  It was this fine Janneke beer label which he peeled off a bottle while on a recent trip to the Netherlands.  He assures me that he enjoyed the beer and that it is in fact quite rare and so a special treat indeed.  My thanks to you Gé!<p>
A second opinion always is appreciated.  I recently received email from one Job Nijs from Rotterdam who assures me that Janneke is in fact available at almost any supermarket...  So, there you have it..  On my next trip to the Hague I'll have to do some research!
