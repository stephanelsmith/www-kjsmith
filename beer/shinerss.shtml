A contribution from Davis B in east Texas, Home of Red Hills, Green Pines, and Bluebonnets.  This label results from an impromptu email "chat" with Davis one evening as I was surfing about the web.  He emailed me asking how to remove the label.  What followed were several replies as he worked off a label and then this great scan.<br>
So, what about the beer?  In his own words, "I was just finishing up a SHINER SUMMER STOCK
(a Old German Kolsch Beer - whatever the heck that is - blends Wheat and
Barley Malt) ... a little heavier than their HONEY brew .... little more
widespread than a true micro .....  interesting though."  
Many thanks for the effort to get that label off the bottle!
