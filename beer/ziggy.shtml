My thanks to Bud for his fine contribution to my page.  Bud passed a milestone recently in his beer drinking career which he shares with us in his own words:<p>

I like your site! I'm a long-time beer drinker, and began collecting labels about five years ago.  The label I'm attaching (well, a digital photo of it) was from my one thousandth different beer that I can prove. Many of the ones I had years ago are no longer brewed, some bottles had painted labels, and a few labels were simply  impossible to remove.<p>
The beer itself was mediocre; but it'll always be special to me because I'll never live long enough to have a two thousandth.<p>
