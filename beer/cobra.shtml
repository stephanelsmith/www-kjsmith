Recently back from the Hague in the Netherlands on business.  One of the few nice things about frequent travel to the same place is the chance to try out different resturants.  This label came from a small Indian resturant in the central part of the Hague.  The beer was very nice, smooth as the label says which helped with the lesiurly dutch pace of service.  We were a good three hours at table!<br>
