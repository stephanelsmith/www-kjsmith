<h3>
From Dave Edgar in Seattle comes this collection presenting a fantastic set of labels from all over North America.  These labels have never been attached to a bottle, a true collection from a true collector.  They were donated to me via my brewer brother from Dave Edgar, a brewer friend who seriously collects labels.  While the "never used" condition kinda goes against my philosophical requirement that a label is only as good as the brew in the bottle, I am no purist and these are great labels, worth to be seen. My sincere thanks to Dave for the collection I proudly display on the following pages....<p>
For those wishing to trade with and/or just share collecting experiences with Dave, he has kindly given permission to provide his email as follows: <A HREF ="mailto:Dave.Edgar@craftbrewers.com">Dave.Edgar@craftbrewers.com</A>  Drop him a note, he dosn't bite!<p>
