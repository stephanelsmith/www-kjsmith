"Steinlager:  Well what can i say, it's just like the label says, "New 
Zealand's Finest Beer" respected as such all over New Zealand, except in 
Speight's country (DEEP South). An extremely refreshing beer, but it must 
not, at any cost be drunken out of a can that would be sacrilage! Only 
bottles for this beer!"

"Light Ice is a very fruity beer, not bad, if u like low alcohol beer. Perfect for when u arn't looking to get plastered, or u are the sober driver for the night."
