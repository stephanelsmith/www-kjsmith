There are numerous local breweries throughout China.  Meihe Fresh is brewed in the town of Meihekou in Manchuria, China.  It is an excellent lager beer.  <p>
With a dry climate and good glues, I was generally unable to remove labels from the bottle I drank.  At the request of our Shell China hosts most of the labels were removed by the waitresses in whatever resturant we happened to be.  As they see few, if any, westerners in many of the places we visited, the request was usually viewed with considerable amusement on the part of the waitresses.
