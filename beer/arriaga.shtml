El Aguila Negra, from a closed brewery in the north of Spain, (Asturias, Spain's Celtic area).  Samuel writes that this was a dark transparent beer with a good taste, also that now spanish collectors would kill to have such a label!  Hmmm, I will settle for this fine scan..

Aguila Amstel, Amstel's mark in Spain.  Samuel sends this scan as I have a lot of Amstel labels, so now I begin to have a sub-collection of Amstel labels worldwide.

Samuel Arriaga is contributing to this page with these fine scans and notes which I have paraphrased here.  Samuel is spanish but is now attending university in Toulouse, France.  His forwarding email, (9962793@routsip.univ-tlse1.fr) has failed me on several attempts at a personal reply.. so Sam, if you read this send me a note with the right return!  Until then, my sincere thanks for the scans.
