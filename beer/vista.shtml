On China's east margin, the province of Jiangsu lies one of China's oldest coal-mining districts including that of Yanzhou.  We spent three t=days there reviewing data and discussing projects with the local authorities.  It was very "down-home" and chinese, they don't get many foreign devil visitors in this part.  We stayed at the local mining bureau guest house and ate with the locals each morning.  I was never a fan of xifan for breakfeast even though a billion Chinese wake up to this each day.  For three days we did also.  The evenings we did have some great meals and washed things down with Vista beer, a fairly generic and forgettable brew.
