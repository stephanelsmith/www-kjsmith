During my undergraduate years, I lived on the coast of
Washington State's Puget Sound.  The sound is a wonderful
inland sea arm of the Pacific Ocean.  With the cool richness
of the salt water and the protection of the complex
coastline, the sound is a fascinating aquarium rich in life
and diversity.  Given my proximity to this environment, it
is little wonder that I took up scuba diving.  Diving is
different from many other activities.  It is an
introspective activity because you cannot talk while there.
Entering the water is a special moment, when you leave the
planet of your birth and enter into a new world entirely
different and seemingly independent.  It is totally alien
and yet as close as the nearest shore!  The first thing you
experience is the cold water seeping into every part of your
suit, the feeling of weightlessness, the dimness, and the
noise of the air rushing through the regulator with each
breath you take.<P>
Not far from the town of Anacortes is a wonderful beach and
park called Rosario Beach.  There you can look south across
a straight of water to the north shore of Whidbey Island.
Separating Whidbey from the mainland is a very narrow channel
called Deception Pass because there the currents are very
strong and change constantly in direction with the changing
of the tides.  Rosario Beach lies at the west entrance of
the pass, beyond the main tides, but still washed by strong
currents.<P>
We had heard tell of an anchor lost some 60-100 ft deep off
the beach which we wanted to see.  We recognized that we had
little chance of ever finding the anchor but out we waded
into the water happy and confident in the success of our
mission.  As we found ourselves deeper and deeper we noticed
two things, the obvious dimness of our world, and the
increasingly sparse life.  We soon decided that no anchor
was worth the waste of air in our tanks and we moved up the
more interesting territory.  The currents, while taking us a
long way from our starting point, was our friend since we
were able to just relax in a vertical position and let the
current sweep us past the bottom.  Our feet were up in the
"air" and our heads just above the bottom it the topsy-turvy
underwater world.  Due to the current, we saw few fish that
dive, but mostly anemones, sea pens, kelp forests, and other
plants attached to the bottom.  The kelp was the most
interesting, dense underwater forests swaying in the
current.<P>
There were no major incidents on that dive, no crabs to
bring home for supper, just a long swim back the way the
current had carried us.  The return was not difficult.  Even
though out of air by then, we moved into the shallows and
snorkeled in and out of the flooded tide pools along the
coast.  At one moment we spotted a large wolf eel.  This
animal is fairly dangerous if provoked, and it looked the
part, a dull gray-green with a long wide body and small
head.  Its dorsal fin was laying along the length of its
back.  At one moment I touched it with the flat of my diving
knife and it flared its fin along the whole length.  We
decided to leave well enough and continued our return.
Leaving the sea is always an interesting moment.  It is only
then that we could talk about what we had seen and done.
While removing our gear, hauling it back to the cars, we
always made up for our enforced silence.  That day we
returned to our own world well satisfied with our visit.<P>
