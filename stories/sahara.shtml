I am often amazed at how life clings to the most difficult
of environments and conditions.  In my job as a geologist I
have had many opportunities to travel to distant and exotic
places, to see sights many can only read about.  I am often
deeply moved by the beauty as well as the strangeness of
lands remote from my own experience.  The Sahara Desert in
particular left a lasting impression on my mind.  There the
conditions of severe aridity, immense space, and austere
landscapes are brought into sharp focus.  I am amazed by the
fact that even in such an environment people are born, live,
make love, and survive.<P>

I was fortunate to visit the Sahara as part of a geologic
study I was making for the Algerian National Oil Company.
Our itinerary was to take us to the desert oasis town of Ain
Salah where we would pick up our vehicles and drive out into
the desert for 10 days of geological reconnaissance.  I
think that in the desert, nothing is ever quite as easy as
one might think or plan for.  The trip was no exception and
started off with an unexpected landing in the northern
desert town of Ghardaia.  The plane we were flying on
developed icing problems and had to make an early landing.
The mechanic's problem was our opportunity.  Ghardaia is a
thriving town in the heart of the M'Zab oasis.  Driving into
the town for an afternoon, we were presented with a
wonderful view of the village built on a hill above
cultivated fields in the valley.  The buildings are all
painted in soft pastel shades of pink, blue, white, yellow,
and natural orange.  At the top of the hill is the tower of
the town's mosque, a square, sloping structure in the
typical "Maghreb" style.  A newer mosque with a more modern
tower stands at the foot of the town.<P>

We drove to the town square 
<A HREF="/imagint/ghardaia.shtml">
marketplace</a>, the souk, and
passed an agreeable time among the shops and stands.  There
was every sort of produce available, but the crown was the
local dates from the sahara.  These magnificent fruit
provide all the essential ingredients for humans to survive,
packaged in a form both pleasing to taste and eat.  There
was a healer present in the souk giving instruction on
common cures for the various illnesses known locally.
Around the healer a large crowd of people gathered to listen
and learn, demonstrating his importance to the town.  The
people of the M'Zab oasis form the main merchant class of
Algeria, traveling away from the town often for months at a
time.  We were not allowed to enter the town itself.  The
streets are narrow and winding in a labyrinthine maze from
which strangers would easily become lost.  Tales are not
uncommon about tourists entering the town never to be seen
again, usually with the suggestion that they ended up in
sexual servitude to the lonely women enclosed behind their
pastel walls.  Although I have personally heard this story
on different occasions from different sources, I rather
doubt it is much more than idle fantasy, though interesting.<P>

When another plane arrived we continued our winding way to
the deep desert at the oasis of Ain Salah.  We arrived late
and were greeted by a night of crystal purity, filled with
the stars and Milky Way glistening across the sky.  We would
grow accustomed to this sky over the next 10 days!  Our work
included visits to important outcropping strata of rock
which we hoped would produce oil in the deep subsurface
farther north of the area.  We were driven about in land
cruisers often across the flat desert surface, or reg.  In
the low oueds (wadis), or drainage's we would see many forms
of shrub and grass growing.  Away from these oueds the
desert was complete.  It was not uncommon to drive for
several hours and not see a single living thing, not a
blade of grass.  The aspect was lunar.  The distance
revealed the formations we intended to visit.  We usually
drove along marked "pistes" or tracks known for centuries by
the local Tuareg dwellers.  I learned that oases in the
desert come in various sizes often expressed by the number
of date palms the water would support.  Towns like Ain Salah
or Ghardaia grew around oases which would support extensive
plantations of date palms as well as other crops.  Other
oases may support perhaps ten to twenty palms, or maybe one
or two.<P>

Our most poignant moment on the trip occurred at one such
<A HREF="/imagint/algeria.shtml">
oasis</a>.  It was a small, ten-tree affair about located on the
old piste between Ain Salah and Arak, a town and caravan
stop from early times.  A new paved road built by the French
has bypassed this route and the oasis lies nearly abandoned.
To one side of the oasis was an old guest house now falling
into ruin.  We stopped at this place to eat our lunch and
wash in the water.  We saw a family sitting in the desert
sun about a hundred feet from the trees.  They were dressed
in the robes typical of the Tuareg people.  The location was
spectacular, but the conditions were of extreme poverty.  I
still wonder how they managed to survive, and marvel at the
sustaining power of the Sahara Date.  As we milled about
eating our bread, dates, and oranges, the father stood and
walked over to where we were.  Beneath the swirls of robes
and turban I saw his blue eyes and dark skin that marked his
Berber race.  We gave him bread and oranges to take to his
family, a wife, son, and daughter.  There was little in
common with his language and the arabic of our hosts and the
communication was difficult.  He was agitated and eventually
managed to explain, with the eventual help of his wife, that their
daughter was very ill and needed medicine.<P>

She had a sort of sleeping sickness and seldomly moved.  We
looked about for what we had but could not offer what was
necessary.  We offered to take the daughter to Arak which
was not far away but were refused.  They explained that they
had lived there for many years and did not want to leave.
Finally we left them with a bottle of medicine which would
provide more hope than cure, some more food and we left.<P>

The next week was spent in a wonder of new outcrops,
spectacular mountains, glorious nights, evenings in the
cooks tent drinking mint tea and exchanging stories, and
deepening friendship with our hosts. We climbed a mountain,
got lost in a oued, and walked across the surface of the
moon.  The work was important for the knowledge we learned
of the geology and the samples we collected for analysis in
Houston.  Each day brought a new wonder, a new surprise.  As
the end of the trip arrived it was with a tinge of regret
while we drove out of the mountains, across the reg to the
town of Ain Salah and a welcome shower.<P>

The trip is past now, some three years into my own personal
history.  Yet, it still remains with me, fresh, severe, and
close.  I am amazed at how life has invaded such a region,
become comfortable, and sometimes even thrived.  At the same
time I still reflect back on the family at the oasis, a
daughter who I cannot help but think is no longer alive.  It
bothers me that we were not able to do more, or that the
parents would not allow it.  Perhaps it is Allah's will.  In
the end we were only guests to their world, a fleeting
memory of bread and oranges.<P>
