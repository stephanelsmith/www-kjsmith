One of the pleasures of being a young adult is the ability
to go off on a lark with friends without regard to
difficulties, dangers, or prior planning.  Once when I was in
senior in high school, I had an unplanned winter tour of
Washington State.  Even though it was winter, in Yakima
where I lived there was very little snow.  Always interested
in an adventure, the need for snow seemed a wonderful excuse
for a trip.  Patty Garcia, my former girlfriend and still
great friend, Bob Maier, my best friend, and I had in mind a
day of snow on the ski slopes at White Pass in the heart of
Washington's Cascade mountains.  This chain of mountains
running parallel to the Pacific Coast from Canada to
California divides the state into two halves.  The
separation is climatic as well as geographic with the west
side dominated by cool damp maritime air and the east by dry
continental air.  The town of Yakima sits near the foothills
in the arid steppe of the east side.<P>

We decided that Patty would drive us in her VW bug.  The
route would take us up the Tieton River drainage winding to
the 4500 Ft. high pass and a winter paradise.  The drive was
half the fun, but we found as we arrived at the top that the
pass was crowded and cold.  None of us skied and as we ran
about in the snow it seemed increasingly obvious that the
logical thing to do was to continue down the other side and
spend the afternoon in Seattle, queen city of the northwest.
We had told our parents that we would be at White Pass and
this decision was not without some risk.  Still we were
halfway there and the day was ahead of us, so down we drove
in Patty's VW into the deep green of the western lowlands.
In Seattle we spent our time wandering along the waterfront,
visiting the shops, feeding the gulls, breathing the salt
air.  By early afternoon it had started to rain lightly and
we knew that it would get worse.  In winter, rain in Seattle
usually meant snow in the mountains.  It was at that time
when Patty told us her windshield wipers were not working!.
Calling our parents from Seattle was out of the question and
we didn't have time or money to have the wipers repaired.<P>

Knowing that we were in for a difficult drive back we left
quickly in hopes to get past the worst of the weather.
White Pass was too high, winding, and treacherous for the
conditions we faced so we chose instead to take the main
freeway over the lower Snoqualmie Pass at about 3000 Ft.
Even driving slowly, Patty was having difficulty seeing and
as the rain increased we were forced to improvise a
solution.  Bob and I removed the laces from our boots and
made two long cords.  We stopped the VW and tied one cord to
each wiper.  Passing these cords through the side windows,
we were able to operate the wipers manually, allowing us to
continue.  As we gained altitude the evening came and the
rain turned to snow.  It piled up on the window and car in
thick slushy mounds and the wiper system quickly gave little
more than a thin viewing slit requiring occasional stops to
clear.  It was into the night when we finally reached the
pass.  The road curved and leveled out and one of those
magical events took place, so common in the passes of the
Cascades, but always surprising and remarkable.  In the
space of a quarter mile the weather went from the heavy
precipitation of the west to the crystal clear skies of the
east side.  We stopped and cleaned the window, retrieved our
laces and quickly shut the windows against the cold, now
dropping rapidly into the teens.  The drive down the broad
dry road was a welcome relief from the stress of the ascent.
We stopped for gas in the town of Ellensburg and, looking at
Patty's trusty VW, we saw that the slush and snow had frozen
into a layer of solid ice up to two inches thick in places.
It would be over a week before all that ice finally melted
and fell.<P>

The adventure, unplanned, poorly prepared, risky and
dangerous, was a blazing success.  We all felt exhilarated
and satisfied the next day as we talked about it back at
school.  Other than the moments of anxiety along the route,
I don't think we ever reflected back on the risks we had
taken.  Perhaps our guardian angels were with us on that
trip.  Still, I have no regrets for the decisions we made
and the memory of that day of companionship and adventure
will always remain special to me.<P>
