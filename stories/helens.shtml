During my university years in Washington State, I spent a
good deal of time in the mountains climbing and hiking the
high country.  The volcanic cones that rise in a line
loftily above the surrounding peaks are a particular
attraction for most climbers, and I was certainly not
immune.  Given the numbers of people who can be found there, 
my friends and I were always trying to find new and
different ways to achieve the summit while avoiding the
crowds.  One year a group of us decided to attempt an ascent
of Mt. St. Helens in January.  We were sure to avoid meeting
the typical summer confusion, and we had the added element
of danger of a winter climb.  The weather in the Cascades in
winter is mostly poor and much depended on finding a clear
day.  Even the roads leading to the mountains are not plowed
and would require a possible overnight hike to a base camp.
Mt. St. Helens lies considerably west of the main line of
Cascade volcanoes and rises from a lower base elevation.
That lower elevation we felt would improve our chances of
having a clear drive route to base.  We were fortunate that
the weather forecast for our chosen day was good and we
packed and left for the mountain.<P>

Our plan was to arrive at base in the late morning and
immediately begin our climb.  We would cut a snow bench to
camp about halfway up, and make the summit early the next
morning.  The wind began to pick up as we approached the
area we wanted to camp carrying with it blown snow and ice
crystals.  Even though we could see clear sky directly
overhead, we realized we were in for a difficult night.  We
cut the bench and pitched tents in steadily deteriorating
conditions.  Soon we were in a full "whiteout" with zero
visibility and had to spend the rest of the afternoon in the
tents hoping for better conditions in the morning.  The
blowing snow and ice loaded on the tents and eventually
collapsed one.  The night was an odessy of misery punctuated
by brief struggles outside in the blizzard digging the snow
off the remaining tent.  The morning arrived with no
abatement in the whiteout and we worried about our ability
to find our route off the mountain.  Digging out the two
now-collapsed tents was a welcome activity after the boredom
and worry of the prior night.  As we worked our way down the
mountain the wind slowed and visibility returned.  The last
obstacle was a low snow ridge which we needed to cross to
get to the snow field which led to our base and vehicles.
The ridge was low and not impressive, but the wind across it
blew about 70 to 80 miles and hour.  It would be impossible
to stand in such conditions so we laid down and inched up
the side, the wind increasingly pulling on us as we neared
the crest.  Finally, in the lee side we were free to stand
and, defeated, to return to our cars and homes.<P>

Back at the vehicles, I still recollect looking back at the mountain, brilliant in the clear January sky.  At the summit
I could see huge plumes of snow and ice crystals blowing off
the top.  Benign in the clear light of day, I well knew the
danger that invitation posed.  On 18 May, 1980 the mountain
immolated itself in a blast of fire and ash.  I reflect the
many days I spent on the slopes now destroyed.  Climbs both
successful and not, all in the past.  I left a part of
myself on the mountain which must remain, perhaps buried in
the ash, but ever close in my memory.<P>
