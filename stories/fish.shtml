When I worked for the Forest Service in the Cascades of
southern Washington State, I lived in a compound near the
town of Willard.  Along one side of the compound ran a
mountain stream.  My friends and I who worked there would
often spend evenings around the stream as it was very
relaxing.  On weekends we would have things to do,

mountains to climb</a> , civilization to visit and the stream was usually
on its own.  One weekend I stayed at the compound and spent
a lot of time exploring the area, including the stream.  I
had the idea to go snorkeling in the stream.  Since the water
drains the snows of the high country, it runs very cold.  I
had a full scuba suit which I was obliged to wear so I was
thankful to be alone that day!  It was really fascinating to
get into that stream.  The water was generally a foot or two
deep and quite swift in places.  There were occasional pools
where the dippers looked for their supper.  Those were
deeper, up to several feet.  The water was absolutely crystal
clear, the movement washed streams of bubbles across my
mask, that and the cold were the only indication of water
between me and the bottom.<P>
As I worked myself into a deeper pool, I was totally
absorbed by the life and texture of the stream bottom.  At
one moment I caught a movement out of the corner of my eye
and upon looking up I saw a beautiful rainbow trout
suspended in space about two feet from me.  It just hung
there in the crystal water atmosphere.  Quickly it moved
away at my movement, but it left me with a vision of such
wonder and clarity.  It is odd how the world of the
familiar can be easily transformed by a new perspective.
Many times I had wandered around and by that stream, but by
actually entering into its soul I saw wonders I had not
expected to exist.  The stream became ever more special to
me that day as it provided a new jewel in my cache of
experiences.<P>
