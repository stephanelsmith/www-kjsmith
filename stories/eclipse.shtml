As a kid I was always a nut about astronomy.  It was an interest that was to 
remain with me until the present, and will continue into the future as well.  I 
remember one particular astronomical event which took place in the mile-high 
city of Helena.  It was a total solar eclipse, but the story of that eclipse begins years before.  Then I was 12 years old and I received a Golden Nature Guide about astronomy called "Stars".  I have no trouble recollecting it as remains at my desk even as I type these words, taped and battered from long hours of study.<P>

It was in the section on eclipses that I learned there was to be a solar 
eclipse passing through the Pacific Northwest in 1979.  That 
was an event that I marked in my mental calendar!  I wondered at the time where 
I would be at that distant date, and whether I would miss the eclipse.  Children 
wonder those things I suppose, but I needn't have as I was to find 
myself living on the centerline of totality that day.  In fact, perhaps by subliminal planning or just luck I realize now that most places I had lived were on or near the centerline of that eclipse path.<P>

Winter in the Rockies is not for the faint of heart.  In the high country fierce cold 
air builds and then, being dense, descends and blows down the valleys.  Snow 
accumulates and dries to a hard powder.  Cloudy skies alternate with clear and 
bitter cold days.  In general, weather patterns follow a course from west to east.  
As the air rises towards the mountain passes the clouds build, and dissipate as 
they cross to the eastern lower elevations.  Clear conditions are a hit-or-miss proposition at best.<P>

The forecast for 26 February, 1979 was not good.  Missoula where I lived was 
predicted to be overcast and my friends and I decided to make a early morning 
dash for Helena on the east side of the Continental Divide where we expected 
better skies to see the eclipse.  Even Helena did not have favorable 
forecast for that morning.  We took the chance and were rewarded with a 
spectacular sight.  An eclipse is almost spiritual.  The memory is something that 
will never pass.  We drove back to Missoula after the eclipse and in my 
apartment I sat down at my typewriter and wrote the following words:<P>

"While the experience of the eclipse is still fresh in my mind, I would like to tell of 
it.<P>

Four of us, (me driving) left this morning on a three-hour drive to Helena east of 
the Continental Divide.  We found a small hill just south of town and in fact 
partially within town.  During the partial phases of the eclipse I set up my 
telescope and screen to project a sharp 5cm diameter solar image with a large 
dark "bite" out of it.  I set it up low enough so that the children present could also 
see.  It was a social event, as totality grew near more and more people (and their 
dogs), gathered talking and laughing excitedly to the top of the hill.  There were 
thin high clouds which had no effect, but there were thicker clouds much lower in 
patches which drifted in and out of view.  At times we thought that all was lost as 
the clouds gathered and our view was obscured.  Then they dispersed and 
excitement ran high.  The clouds actually provided a service by filtering down the 
intensity of the sun during partiality.  I took several photos.<P>

My projecting setup proved very good for group viewing and there were many 
people round about it.  A TV newsman used it to film the crescent sun.  About 
ten minutes before totality the sky was visibly dimmed and the crescent was 
growing very thin indeed.  I remember thinking that there must be less than a 
minute left to go when, looking behind me, the western horizon was very dark!  
Upon seeing that, a stillness came on the folks, an anticipation.  It was twilight, 
the horizon in front was blue, behind it was black.  Then, the moon appeared!  
No longer a very large bite into the sun, but a black disk surrounded by the 
diffuse corona.  The sky was dark and the lights came on in the city below.  We 
all shouted and cheered in joy and wonderment.  Although I have read and 
looked at photos of many eclipses, I was not prepared for what I saw.  It was 
awesome and wonderful, it really was.  It was much larger than I had expected, 
very near and familiar.<P>

I wasted no time and took many photos and even changed lenses.  Perhaps I 
spend too much time with my equipment and not enough in just looking.  
Certainly I did not see as much as I might have, and I was rushed to be sure, but 
I am satisfied none the less.  Soon the western horizon grew light and all the 
horizon around was of a weird brownish light, very diffuse.  Then it was over, the 
sun peeked over the rim, twilight came, and the day returned.  We watched the 
solar crescent projected through my telescope.  As people wandered away, all 
concluded that it was a grand and awesome sight.  Satisfaction was general 
though it was too short.  That, I expect, was a common opinion.  We stayed until 
the very end of the partial phase.  So... that is how I saw my first eclipse, (but not 
last!)."<P>
