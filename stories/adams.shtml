My summers during the time I was in university were spent living
in the Cascade Mountains and surveying with the US Forest Service.
Climbing was a natural activity there and the tall snow-covered
volcanic peaks always beacon'd on the horizon.  The high country 
always offers fresh experiences, new twists, occasional danger
and endless variety.  No matter how often one went on some adventure,
there awaited something unexpected and wonderful.  It was on one dawn 
morning with a friend at the foot of Mt. Adams that the mountain 
spoke to us.<p>

We arrived the night before as was our habit and set up camp in an
alpine meadow adjacent to the fabulous flower-covered Bird Creek 
Meadows.  Although summer in the low country, spring arrives late
at timberline and the flowers were at their peak.  We enjoyed the 
sun setting over the ragged horizon and then we prepared for the 
night.  Climbs start with an early rise before sunup, a quick and 
not very satisfying breakfast and, shouldering our sacs, a walk
in the darkness towards the foot of the mountain towering before us.
That morning we reached the last moraine piled high against the 
rising slope.  When we topped the hill we could finally see out 
across the vast snowfields leading ever upward.
It was dawn with the sun just below the horizon, the sky bright
with promise.  The sight from that vantage was otherworldly, the dim 
forms of the foothills below us, the sterile stone and snow-covered
landscape around us.  We stopped to take a
short rest, look at the path we had used now that there was light, 
and enjoy the spectacle.   <p>

As we sat and looked about, we became aware of a low droning sound. 
It was not steady, but at times rising, at times falling.  
The sound seemed to be everywhere at once, surrounding us yet coming 
from nowhere.  We looked about
but could not identify the source of this sound.  It seemed
to us to be emanating from the very earth on which we stood, as if
the mountain itself was speaking to us, murmuring secret wisdom we 
could not understand.  The air was still
that morning, brisk and cold, the sun would soon be up and we had an
appointment elsewhere.  As
I leaned down to tighten the laces on my boots, I noticed
the sound grow stronger.  Checking my discovery I soon realized that
it was the low hum of air currents
passing through the porous throat of the moraine.  <p>

The realization of the cause of the hum did not lessen our
awe for the moment nor our certain conviction that we had
been privy to counsels given to us by the mountain itself.
Peeling my grapefruit later that day at the summit, some
7000 feet above our point of departure, I wondered about
that sound.  What had the mountain been trying to tell us?
Perhaps we had not "conquered" the mountain, perhaps we had merely
been allowed by its grace to feel the wind of the summit.<P>
