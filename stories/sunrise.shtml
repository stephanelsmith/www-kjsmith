As a young man growing up in the Pacific Northwest, one of
the greatest pleasures I had was to visit, play, and live in
the Cascade mountains.  My home town is located on the arid
steppes of Eastern Washington, but on the western horizon
the high, snow-clad peaks of the mountains always beckon.
During my first two years of college at the local junior
college, my friends and I would often spend a weekend of
climbing.  We were naturally lured to the larger volcanic
peaks which stood out above the rest of the mountains and,
from the town of Yakima, that usually meant mounts Adams,
Hood, or St. Helens.  These three mountains are the subject
of one of the most beautiful Indian legends of the
Northwest, the Tahmahnawis Bridge, or the Bridge of the
Gods.  The Columbia River cuts a gorge through the Cascades
separating Mt. Hood (Wyeast) on the South from Mts. Adams
(Klickitat) and St. Helens (Loo-Wit) on the north.  The
story relates the tale of how chiefs Wyeast and Klickitat
broke the peace between their peoples over their desire to
win the heart of the beautiful maiden who lived at the stone
bridge over the river.  The Great Chief had built the bridge
so that the people could visit each other.  To Loo-Wit He
had entrusted the keeping of the sacred fire so that all the
people would have warmth.  In their quarrel, the people of
the chiefs forgot their friendships and angered the Great
Chief, who then destroyed the bridge and extinguished the
fire.  Loo-Wit fled north away from the destruction and she,
along with Wyeast and Klickitat were transformed into
mountains.  They are known today as the Guardians of the
Columbia.<P>

One of the most beautiful experiences I have had in the
mountains occurred among the Guardians during a climb on Mt.
Adams.  In the mountains it was our usual custom to break
the climb with a night campout somewhere up the side of the
mountain, usually just above timberline where the views were
especially good.  I was with my friend Paul Boving and we
were taking the standard route up Adams.  The approach to
the mountain is from the south and we had parked our car
somewhat below timberline in a place called Bird Creek
Meadows.  Our route would take us up a spur of the mountain
which jutted out towards the southeast of the mountain.  The
top of the spur is called the Lunch Table.  For the majority
who prefer to climb the mountain in a single day, the lunch
table is the usual rest spot.  From there the main ascent
starts as the mountain is now covered in eternal snow and
the slope is fairly steep.  Paul and I had arrived in the
late afternoon to begin the climb.  We hiked up the spur
towards the lunch table in the clear evening light and chose
a campsite near a small clump of stunted alpine fir a bit
below the table.  In the distance we could see Mt. St.
Helens to the west, and Mt. Hood to the south, silently
watching the Columbia.  We cleared out a flat spot in the
snow and fixed our camp, ate, and went to sleep.<P>

The morning always comes early in the mountains.  On the
exposed ridge we soon woke up in the early light.  The cold
went down to our bones and with difficulty we moved about
and prepared a warm breakfast.  Sunrise was most welcome as
we greeted the warming rays of the sun.  We decided to wait
for the sun to rise on distant St. Helens before we set out
with the ascent, giving us time for another cup of hot tea.
With the sun already at our backs, we figured we had just a
few minutes.  The wait began to drag and for us the sun was
getting quite high.  We wondered and discussed why St.
Helens could remain in the shade.  Soon we noticed the
bright sunlight falling on the many smaller peaks to each
side of St.  Helens and finally, at the very top of the
mountain, the dull blue-gray changed to a streak of
brilliant white, sunrise had finally arrived.  We realized
at that moment that the delay was caused by the shadow of
Mt. Adams!  We could now quite clearly see the shadow
extending out in perfect alignment, falling on the other
mountain about 40 miles away, an event occurring only twice
a year.  Soon the side of St. Helens glowed in the morning
sunlight and the profile of Mt. Adams was silhouetted
against it.  At one point during this show we even
recognized the profile of the spur we were standing on and,
moved by the obvious logic of the situation, raised our
hands and cast rabbits on St. Helens, undoubtedly a record
of some sort.  We stayed and watched the event until the
entire mountain was bathed in sunlight, then we stirred
ourselves to our own appointment with the summit of Adams.<P>

I think that the beauty of the mountains is often found in
such unexpected events.  They remind you that there are
hidden moments and pleasures that only reveal themselves
after a considerable investment of time.  These moments
become jewels in my memory and I guard them jealously.<P>
