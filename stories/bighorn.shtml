I spent my first summer as a professional geologist working
as a gold prospector in the Mojave Desert of Arizona.
The property I was prospecting on was quite large,
comprising several square miles of varying terrain from wide
flat, and hot valleys, to rough mountains.  This area had
been the site of extensive mining activity in the late
1800's and a last period working in the second world war
years.  Most of the workings and equipment still remain
onsite although heavily picked over from the years of
abandonment.  My job was primarily to hike and roam the
property looking for outcrops and formations favorable for
the concentration of gold ore.  The concentrations we were
interested in were small enough that there was little hope
of ever seeing the gold directly.  I would mark the places I
wanted samples to be taken and indicate the location on a
map.  In the following days one or two young men working on
the property would take the map and notes and collect the
samples which would then be sent to a lab for assays.<P>

For me the job was wonderful.  I would spend my day's alone
hiking in that magnificent country, noting the flowers, the
animals, the geology, visiting the mining works.  To the
superficial eye, the desert looks desolate and vast.  Hiking
from early morning to early evening, I found the desert to
be intimate and alive.  There were many wonders for me on
each day out, an owl hiding in a mine shaft, a snake
climbing a small tree, quail faking a broken wing to lead me
away from its nest, a tarantula spider scaring the driller's
wife.  There were occasional more memorable events that
summer including the day I was fortunate enough to greet a
bighorn ram.<P>

In general, the property was flat to hilly in the south and
west, and mountainous on the east and north.  As I was
working the northern areas one week, I was noticing a good
deal of bighorn "sign" in the area, the droppings and prints
of several animals.  I was very anxious to see these sheep,
especially a ram as they have become quite rare in recent
years.  I generally worked alone, and I tend to walk very
quietly so I did not have to wait very long before I saw the
sheep herd.  It was a small group, six or seven animals
consisting of two females and several young.  Although I was
seeing this group regularly I was disappointed that it did
not include a dominant male.  That situation was soon to
change.  One day I was working an especially rough area
around a mountainside.  There was a ravine cutting deeply
into the south flank.  I had started the morning from the
road-end relatively high and behind the mountain on the
north side.  When I got to the ravine I decided to cross it
high on the flank, work my way down the west side, and work
into the ravine low on the south side.  This path meant that
I would have a difficult climb back up the mountain on the
east side of the ravine.<P>

As I was returning up along the rim above the ravine, I came
to a flat bare rocky area.  On one side of the rim rock was
a cliff dropping off some 50 feet or so, ahead of me was more
open rock, terraced to various interesting levels.  It was a
nice place to take a rest and as I walked towards the cliff
for a view and the breeze I suddenly heard a loud scrambling
noise.  A mature ram had been lying at the foot of a terrace
in the shade.  Arriving quietly from the south, I had been
out of view and unheard until very close.  The animal stood,
ran about 20 feet away, and turned towards me.  I had
stepped to the cliff and glanced down, and, dropping to one
knee I looked at the ram, now some 40 to 50 feet from me.
He was fabulous, with his horns curling over one full turn.
He stood there looking at me, and I at him.  For me there
was no where to go, I had seen that immediately.  We looked,
and then he turned and left.  The encounter could not have
lasted for more than a few seconds, but with adrenaline
pumping into my veins, the whole thing was played as in slow
motion.  I stared at the ram, looking, recording, fully
aware of my position, but with fascination and excitement
rather than fear.  The sound of his hoofs on bare rock, his
breathing, the dull tan-brown of his coat, and most of all
his head, his eyes looking at me, and his horns.<P>

Then he left, just like that it was past.  I did not recover
so quickly.  As the adrenaline wore off I began to tremble
with the emotion and thrill.  I stood there, on the edge of
the cliff, feeling the breeze, thinking and watching it move
into the distance.  The rest of the day passed in a daze,
small and unimportant.  It was the bighorn only that mattered
then.  This I wondered: as
these animals become increasingly rare how many more will
ever have the chance to view them?  My encounter I consider
as a gift to me and I write this so that maybe I may share
it with others and earn that gift.<P>
