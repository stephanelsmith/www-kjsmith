My first job after university was spent prospecting for gold
in the Mojave Desert of Arizona.  I had many wonderful
experiences there in the desert, including a memorable
encounter with a hawk.  The property I was working was quite
large and each day took me to new and interesting areas.
One day I went to work in the vicinity of an old gold mine.
The rusting hulks of motors and drill bits and old mine
shafts were fascinating.  About mid morning as I was working
my way around and up a small hill I heard what sounded like
a rush of air above me.  It was a still day and I was
curious as to what it was, but upon looking up I saw
nothing.  Over the next several minutes this happened
several times, each time getting a little closer.  I
knew it must be a hawk, but it was never there each time I
looked.  I realized that it must be diving out of the sun
and that instead of looking back where I heard the
sound, it might be better to look out opposite the sun.
This rewarded me the next time with a good sight of the hawk
swooping away into the distance.  I was very bothered by
this time as the hawk was getting closer with each stoop.  I
stopped from time to time, and the attacks stopped, but each
time I continued, so did the attacks.  I found myself
thinking about those sharp talons and wishing I had a hard-
hat.<P>

Soon I was forced to give up the march and turn back.  It
was an odd mix of feelings and emotions to have been
defeated by an animal much smaller than myself, which
threatened but never actually touched me.  Yet the threat
was real, and I yielded.  As I walked back down to the
mining area and down a path to my vehicle, the hawk
hovered in the breeze moving up the mountainside about
twenty feet above me.  As I got farther down the path, it
hovered higher and higher above me, and I never saw
it when it finally left.  I had time that summer in the
desert to reflect on many things, and the attack by the hawk
was often on my mind.  With nature and natural things
you usually know where you stand, life is stripped of the
many complications we face in the city.  With the hawk,
there was no question of calling its bluff, it wasn't, it
didn't know how.  It was merely protecting its territory,
and probably its nest the way it instinctively knew.  I knew
that, and turned away, its as simple as that... and yet
perhaps not so in that I am able to reflect on the event,
and learn, and to record it.<P>
