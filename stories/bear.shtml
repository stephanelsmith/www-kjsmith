When I was going to graduate school, I lived in Montana in
the town of Missoula.  It was a great town on the west slope
of the northern Rockies.  I had easy access to many
wonderful places to climb and hike and just be outdoors, but
one of the best of all was Glacier National Park up north
next to Canada.  On one occasion while visiting the park, I
had the chance to grin down a grizzly bear!  On this visit,
my best friend from high school and college, Bob Maier, was
visiting.  We had been up in the high country hiking and
camping, and had been somewhat nervous from time to time
about the aspect of meeting the park's famous inhabitants.
Bears are very rare in the Cascades we were used to.  We had
had a great time with no encounters and were now driving the
highway up the pass to the Continental Divide.<P>

It is not unusual to cars parked by the side of the road in
the park, and it usually means that somebody had spotted an
animal.  We saw two cars stopped like that and pulled in
behind them.  The people there told us that there was a
female moose in the woods off to the side.  Curious, we set
out into the brush and woods to see.  The day was wet and
overcast, with that dense saturated color so common in the
northwest.  As we ventured in, we saw no sign of the moose
and were getting disappointed.  Eventually, we came to a
small marshy area where we thought we could see the moose
farther on in the woods.  Bob got up on a wet slippery log
and crossed a wet area to get a better view.  Just as he
made it to the farther side, I saw the "moose" raise its
head to look at us.  It had the distinct shape of a bear!
We were in an interesting predicament, we knew better than
to run, the bear was looking right at us.  Bob, in any case
was trapped and had to get back.  All I could think of
saying at the moment was "Bob, I don't think its a moose!".
He renavagated the slick log and we slowly backed out of the
area.  Our adrenaline was racing as we finally lost sight of
that grizzled gray neck.<P>

Back on the road we were treated to the sight of a mother
moose and one youngster waking across the highway!  The
people were happy for the sight and had no idea of what lay,
50 feet into the woods.  Bob and I too enjoyed watching the
moose as they disappeared into the brush on the opposite
side of the road.  We understood their motivation for the
move.  We had never got close enough to the bear to be a
threat to it, therefor it probably never was a threat to us.
Still, I cherish that memory of encountering such an animal
in the wild.<P>
