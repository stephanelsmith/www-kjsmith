Hawaii... Perhaps to some the name brings thoughts of
distant isles, dreams, or perhaps fond memories.  To me,
thinking back to the 
<A HREF="/imagnw/hawaiip.shtml">
sunset glow of the Kona Coast,</a>
 it is thoughts of wish fulfillment, dreams come true.  I remember
now clearly that beach on the Kona Coast, rocky where an old
lava flow had reached the salt sea, now worn and decked with
small coral reefs.  The sand was an interesting mixture of
black basalt and white coral, the palms providing shade and
texture to the western horizon.  The setting was so exotic
when compared to my home, I was amazed that I was there at
all.  Sitting there, I recollected the long road that led up
to the moment, a childhood dream, an unexpected opportunity.<P>

As a child I was always interested in maps and far away
places, and in particular I was attracted to maps of Hawaii.
Not all the islands would do for me though, I had decided
that I needed to go visit one day the Big Island.  I am not
sure how these thoughts come into the head if a little kid,
I know I was not more than seven or eight when that decision
was taken, and certainly I must have known that it was just
fanciful imagining.  Still, it was fun to think about for a
kid growing up landlocked on the steppes of Eastern
Washington State.  The day-to-day concerns of being a kid
and growing up quickly pushed aside such notions and by the
time I had gotten to university, Hawaii was little more than
a distant memory, an old dream, a wish and nothing more.<P>

In my third year of university my roommate, Bob Maier, and I
got the chance to spend our Christmas holiday in Hawaii.
The offer came quite out of the blue, from a friend of a
friend of Bob.  This random chance was all the more
extraordinary since this friend was from the Big Island.
Recalling that distant wish of mine, I quickly agreed.  Now
I found myself relaxing on the Kona sand.  In the morning I
would be leaving for the mainland.  I had seen and done a
lot in the ten days I had spent on the island.  The places I
visited still sound like music, Waipio, Hilo, Kapoho,
Kilauea, Pohakuloa, Ka Lae.  Before the trip I neither knew
of most of them, nor could I even pronounce them correctly.
Now each held a special place in my mind.  Waipio valley,
home of Kamehameha, last king of independent Hawaii.  A full
day hike across thirteen smaller valleys eroding deeply into
the old Kohala mountains to arrive, but solitude awaited us
there.  Kapoho, the village on the east point that was
destroyed by lava flows only a few years before.  Kilauea
crater, an impressive National Park on the east flank of
Mauna Kea, destined to be its own mountain, and the vaporous
cliffs of the Halemaumau Fire Pit glowing in the late
afternoon sun.  The smell of sulfur returns to my nose even
as I write this.<P>

On the saddle road between Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa we stayed
at Pohakuloa, little more than a cabin on that high arid
volcanic plane.  There Bob and I hiked up Mauna Kea to what
passes as timberline and looked out west towards Hualalai
surrounded by a skirt of clouds in the evening light.  The
sun set as we descended and, returning to our cabin, the
deepening twilight turned to night.  We had a splendid view
of the Milky Way stretching overhead as we arrived.  We
visited Ka Lae, the south point of the island in a search of
Hawaii's green-sand beaches.  There the water, deep blue,
thunders against the exposed basalt cliffs.  The sand is a
mixture of white coral and green olivine crystals brought up
from the earth's mantle by the deep chimneys of fire below
the islands.  Born in violence, the green sand now forms a
calming fringe between the brown land and the blue water of
the Pacific.<P>

Finally Keei, (pronounced "K,A") a village on the Kona Coast
where I stood reflecting on all these places and many others
so recently familiar to me.  I wondered then, as I do now,
at the remarkable luck which brought me there.  How is it
that the childhood wish of a boy infatuated with maps should
be realized so completely.  It was, and is, a fairy tale
where wishes come true.  I knew that day, looking out past
the coconut palms, that I was indeed fortunate.<P>
