As a geologist for an international petroleum company, I
have had occasion to visit interesting places and meet
interesting people.  Usually meetings are carefully planned,
but at times there is a large random element.  I remember
once a short encounter in a public park in Algiers, Algeria.
I had worked on a study contract which my company had with
the Algerian State Oil Company and was in Algeria to make
the final presentation of the study results.  The meeting
had taken a day and a half and the stress of making a good
presentation had been quite tiring.  On the last day, our
hosts had scheduled a nice lunch for our delegation at a
fancy Algiers restaurant prior to our departure.  The
restaurant is located near the large monument to Algerian
Independence on a hill overlooking the city.  Algiers sits
on the African coast in a curve of land between the
Mediterranean Sea and the surrounding hills.  A hilltop park
surrounds the monument and provides wonderful views of the
city arrayed below.<P>

After the lunch we took some time for a walk in the park to
admire the view and relax.  I was happy to have my camera
with me and took several photos of our hosts and the city.
On the camera strap I keep a number of lapel pins for
decoration as these are quite popular in Europe.  At one
point we heard a young woman say "Pins!" and come running
over to see this little collection.  She had been with a
companion who had not taken the courage to run over as the
first had.  We were all amused by her interest and
inhibition and I gladly let her look at the pins, most of
which are from America and so quite exotic from her
standpoint.  After I explained where each had come from, I
offered for her to choose one of her choice as a souvenir.
At this point some shyness set in on her part, and so I
selected a nice pin from Texas and offered it to her.  This
is certainly more than she had hoped for and she accepted it
gladly, thanked me and returned to her companion.<P>

We returned to our walk and my colleagues and the Algerians
had quite a laugh at the impromptu exhibition.  Naturally
they kidded me about my secret to successfully attracting
the attention of pretty young women.  The first day back at
the office in Houston my boss showed up with a number of
pins attached to his suit coat!  Later that day when we got
on the plane to return home I had the time to reflect back
on that moment in the park and the young lady who, perhaps
against her better judgment, took a chance and asked to see
something of interest.  Her friend was not so brave, and
neither so lucky.  I thought about the jokes afterwards, and
the comments.  Was she foolish?  Possibly.  Was she brave?
I cannot know, but she did take the chance, and was happy to
have a souvenir for her trouble and a story to tell.  I have
occasionally wondered about the whereabouts of that pin.  In
a box or drawer?  I prefer to imagine that she keeps it
somewhere, perhaps with other pins where her friends can see
and ask about it, and she can tell her story about the park,
the American, and the pins.<P>
