An African native, the Orange Bishop is an exotic species here in Houston.  These birds, introduced no doubt via the caged-bird trade, have become established in west Houston and it seems their numbers are growing.  This individual visited our garden on 4 February.  He is a male seeming to be starting his spring molt to a stunning bright orange and black plumage.  Imagine my surprise when I saw that "sparrow" on the ground with the strange orange tail!  I have since confirmed this to be a bona-fide Orange Bishop.  Enjoy!
