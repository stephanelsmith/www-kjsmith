This frightened little cardinal found himself inside our home one afternoon being chased about by a big mean creepy man.  Eventually I did manage to guide him towards the open door and his freedom.  I can only imagine the stories he had to tell the others in his flock!

Like several of my garden friends, I am discovering that Cardinals love to play in the sprinkler.  We have everything set up in our homes so perhaps we take showers for granted.  Well, here my friend sits happily in his own shower!<p>

Cardinal stats for the garden.  Cardinals are around basically every day all year, they grace the garden with their color and ceaseless activity.  Numbers vary somewhat from month to month with a noticeable increase starting early summer when the young fledge and join the garden crowd.  <p>
