For three years now a nesting pair of Carolina Wrens have made some hanging plants on our patio their home.  I plan to make things easy for them this comming spring, hope they love their new house, but you see they still are inspecting the hanging baskets carefully.  Such tenacity!<p>

Above we see maman Wren hunting for tasty bugs in the freshly mowed lawn.  Each time the gardener passes, the wrens have such fun, surf's up!

Spring 2013 and love is in the air..  Our handsome male sings a lovely bright song announcing the wonderful nesting spot he has appropriated!

Garden stats for my Carolina Wrens.  Here we see they are never abundant, seldomely more than one or two birds at a time except where children are present.  They are semi-regular visitors except in summer where feeding young encourages many trips to the feeders, suet is a favorite!<p>
