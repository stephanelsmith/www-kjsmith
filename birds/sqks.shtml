Since 12 or 13 April we have been hearing cardinal chicks squealing in the nest each time maman or papa returns with goodies to eat.  Now on 17 April we see the first brave chick to leave the nest for the big world outside, welcome Little Squeaks!  Papa is close to feed and protect the youngster who otherwise shows an active interest in everything around, turning leaves and trying its best.  Nice to have kids running about the garden once again!<br>
Yes, I know, I have named another bird.. Well, kinda sorta.  Squeaks is more a title than a name and as to it being a Miss or Mr, I havn't a clue.  When it grows to a young adult I have no doubt I will no longer be able to distinguish it with a name.  <p>

Here Little Squeaks is 6 days out of the nest (23 Apr) and doing quite well.  I believe it had a sibling that did not fare so well.  I found a little pile of downy down and tiny feathers on the ground and imagine the worst.  Well, Squeaks is with us and papa dotes on it constantly.  It is growing strong, we see it all about from the front of the house to the back.  I believe it explores where it wants and papa just follows along keeping it out of trouble and giving tasty bites.  I hate going to work and not following its progress from day to day.  But then, papa is there so all will be OK.<p>

28 April and Squeaks is looking good, his feathers increasingly red so I am wondering it its Mr Squeaks after all.  He hasn't been around much and I was actually worried for him, now I feel calm again.  Papa as usual is always close and protective.  Just after these photos a big blue jay and a dove flew in.  While Squeaks flew to safety, papa stood his ground against the larger birds.  Nothing happened but papa was ready just the same.  <p>
1 May update, today we have confirmed that Squeaks has a sibling, there are two squeaks in the garden.  The second I reckon is about a week younger than the first, if that is normal or possible.  There you have it, the Brothers Squeakyeracksoff... <p>
