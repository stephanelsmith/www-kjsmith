OK OK OK, I know I know already, one dosn't celebrate English Sparrows, one despises then and chases them.  Well, our flock has been quite behaved really and I cannot bring myself to think bad thoughts about them.  Oh, they are certainly not my favorite friends, but they have played well at the feeders and earned their place.  Note that I am not trying to attract Purple Martins or otherwise putting out nest boxes so that also accounts for my tolorance I am sure.  The photos on this page are dedicated to this year's new brood of youngsters who are loudly chirrping and calling for food and playing together and just being kids in the garden.  <p>
The first photo does include maman so you can see how little these kiddos are with their yellow beaks.  I havn't managed to get a shot of them getting fed by their parents, but today there was an interesting drama.  One of the little chaps saw our Carolina Wren and, being ever hopeful, began shaking its wings and begging pitifully in hopes of a handout.  The wren was quite curious, its motherhood instincts aroused perhaps, but otherwise unwilling to accept the offer to feed the baby.  Here in the last photo one of them poses for a portrait.  C'mon, they ARE cute.. admit it!<p>

Stats show this pestilence is with us most of the time.  There is an ever-so-slight frequency-dispersal in autumn but numbers build in December-January as flocks gather...  Why I put out grain in winter beats me... ;)<p>
