Pine Warblers are occasional visitors at the garden.  Mostly they wish to take a drink in the pool but one morning one came to munch on some sunflower seeds in a feeder already occupied by a rather upset Orange-Crowned Warbler.

Portrait of the little bird.  Our Pine Warbler decided to pose for a couple lovely photos one mid-February day.  It was nice to get some good close-ups.  Little did we know, this was the last we were to see of our friend.  This species normally resides year around here on the Gulf Coast so I do not know if it just found a newer flat in another place, or if something unfortunate happened.  We miss our little friend.
