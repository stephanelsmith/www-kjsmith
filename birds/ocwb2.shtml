Its winter 2013-2014 and our friend is back, with his friends!  Last spring before the bird had left for its migration north I had noticed it visiting a jelly feeder I had placed in the garden.  This fall when he (she?) returned it immediately started inspecting all the various hummingbird feeders around the garden.  Recalling its apparent sweet tooth (beak?), I popped the top off one of the hummingbird feeders to see what might happen.  Instant success!  Happy birdy.  The next day saw a friend as well and soon up to four birds were contending for control of the precious fluid.  Not much is written in the guidebooks about this, although I did see mention in Ehrlich etal Birders Handbook.  The garden is becomming a veritable warbler woods with several Orange Crowned, 5-6 Pine, and occasional flocks of Myrtle warblers flitting about all day every day!
