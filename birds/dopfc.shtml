Whitewing Doves are a nuisance in the gardin.  They are large birds and come in large flocks.  They have large appetites.  To deal with this takes large measures!  I need not only squirl-proof the feeders, but dove-proof them as well.  Even with these steps the birds remain and cannot be gotten rid of, Miss Cooper just does not visit often enough.  The only good news is that the doves are pretty much relegated to bottom-feeding,  They mill about below the feeders and depend on the messy eating habits of the smaller birds.  It provides them with a bit of a living, but really not enough.<p>
All this means that the doves have become irritable and hungry.  So much for the symbolic peacefulness of doves.  Our doves seem to have developed a continuous fight club in the garden.  Morning till evening this goes on, the alpha-males dueling for the scraps.  I have called their presence "The Dove of Peace Fight Club". Where is Miss Cooper?
