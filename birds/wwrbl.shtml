My friend Mr Wilson makes occasional visits to the garden, sometimes to catch tasty bugs, more often to take a swim in the pool.  He was timid at first, waiting for others to leave and then only using the kiddy pool.  As he became comfortable with things he graduated to the main pool and even the others swimming nearby was no bother.  There is nothing so refreshing for a little warbler than a nice splash in the pool, so happy!

A new surprise.  About the time Mr Wilson arrived for his swim early one evening I had the sprinkler going on the beds at the far end of the garden, about the area where he enters.  When he saw the artificial rain, he was very happy to stop and play in the rain rather than make his habitual swim in the pool.  Singing in the rain, its the best thing for Mr Wilson!<br>
(Apologies for the fuzzy photos, low light and big lens, no easy!)<p>

Stats show Mr Wilson is a winter visitor who arrives early and leaves late.  Not sure why the no-show for December, so many mysteries ...
