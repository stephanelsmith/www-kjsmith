Redwing Blackbirds have discovered the garden feast and decided to partake.  This started in late January and at first only a couple birds would visit every few days or so.  It was interesting to see them, old friends from Montana for me.  Now they have started to bring friends and family on a daily basis and when their flock descends on the feeders, everybody need step aside as they take over and gobble everything in sight.  I don't let this stop my filling the feeders, but it certainly is not fun to see all my cardinals, chickadees, and other friends forced to sit at some distance and watch as the blackbirds throw a party for themselves.<p>

Stats show a curious garden effect for these birds.  Basically they nest in swampy/marshy areas, but make many visits to the garden which is not far away.  Seems they enjoy freeloading from time to time.  In winter the young join large flocks and find the garden smorgasboard to their liking.  Autumn is dispersal time.<p>
