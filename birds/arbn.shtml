Robins were the most common yard bird where I grew up in Yakima Washington, at least as I recollect things.  Since moving away these birds have become somewhat rare to me.  It is thus with some pleasure that a few robins have taken to rustling about in the leaves under the backyard shrubs.  Lots of goos bug hunting there I am sure!
