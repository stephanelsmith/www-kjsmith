Blue Jays have pretty much taken over ownership of the garden.  They go where they wish, chase who they want, and eat what they want.  They even have taken on Cooper patrol and heckle the "poor" hawk every time it gets near.  All this requires a certain responsibility and amount of organization, all apparently done behind closed doors.  This rare recent conclave took place in full view until one jay noted the big lens and clicking of the shutter.<br>
(Actually, I this conclave was more about a woman's right to choose, a Blue Jay Lek as it were...)
