I was very surprised one day in 2012 when a magnificent Pileated Woodpecker flew into the garden and landed near the base of our large oak.  I did not have my camera out and was upset not to have an opportunity to photograph the bird.  Two years on we finally received a return visit and this time with a little luck she did pose for a photo.  Do not wait so long for your next visit my lady friend!
