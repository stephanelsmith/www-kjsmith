It's late November and the Ruby Throated Hummingbirds have left the garden for warmer climes south along the Gulf Coast.  Taking their place is an occasional Rufous in winter plumage making its way south from the northwest.  I ask for any news from my family in Seattle!<p>

January now, a new feeder and our Rufous friends are getting some of their spring colors.  <p>

Fairwell portrait of our Rufous friend, his gorget now fully formed, ready for the treck back north.  After this photo was made we saw no more of our little rufous.  May he deliver greetings and our best wishes to family and friends back in Seattle!
