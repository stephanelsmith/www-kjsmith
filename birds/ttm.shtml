A recent regular guest at the feeder is this cute little Tufted Titmouse.  As this bird shares many food and preferences as the Carolina Chickadee, I have been wondering for some time now if we would ever be visited.  Finally, they grace us with their presence!<br>
Occasionally (true confessions) I will give names to my bird friends.  Not sure how it started, but the titmouse pair that make our feeders their table I have taken to calling Mr and Mrs Cutes.  The name does fit...

Dinner and Mr, Mrs Cutes enjoy cracking their sunflower seeds on a convienent branch.  They are like my Chickadees this way...

Titmouse stats, not surprisingly showing my cute frieds to be most frequent during nesting and feeding, dispersing somewhat early in July.<p>
