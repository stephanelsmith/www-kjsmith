A few common grackles make their presence known in my backyard.  Mercifully, they do not roost, flock, or otherwise display creepy behavoir so, I keep the welcome mat out.<p>

Its another spring and our grackle is back.  This time I have to worry a bit.  While mostly well behaved, it has taken a shine to the blue jays' peanuts and just the other day it invited a friend to share in the raid.  The blue jay defends his stash, pursuing the grackle to recover his peanut, but once the grackles start comming in force they will win, most disturbing.  The photo above tells it all, Dr Evil making his sinister plans!<p>

Captian's log supplemental:<br>  I have recently discovered that Dr. Evil is really just a pussy.  This morning while relaxing at my chair watching the goings'on in the garden I saw Dr Evil abscond with another peanut.  He flew down to the nearby border and began to work over his prize.  While so engaged our hero, completely ignorant of the recent theft flew up to the feeder pole to serve himself a tasty treat.  The moment Dr Evil noted the jay's presence he panicked, dropped his precious cargo and flew to the safety of the overhead shrubbery.  The jay never noticed and just grabbed his peanut and parted.  After, when the coast was clear the good doctor returned and resumed his dinner.  Dr Evil, you are SUCH a poser!<p>

Garden stats for our grackles seem odd with two periods of frequent visits, unsure why on this one.<p>
