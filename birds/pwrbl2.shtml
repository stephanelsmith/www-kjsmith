Winter 2013-2014 and the warblers are really filling the garden.  In addition to 4 or more Orange Crowneds' and no end of Yellow Rumped warblers, we have 6 or so Pine warblers visiting all day every day.  There are two adult males, maybe two adult females and juvinal birds as well.  Each look a bit different, all the same..  Kaufman recommends getting to know your bird plumages well and I believe there is nothing quite so adapted for this as a well-stocked garden feeder.  <p>
