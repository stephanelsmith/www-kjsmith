While spring is a time of migratin and mad variety in the garden, summer is no less active.  Summer is the time to reproduce, and our birdies are very busy.  I must imagine each day in June we have some 10,000 bebe english sparrows, a thousand or so bebe house finchs (OK, a bit of exaggerations.. maybe), blue jays, starlings, grackels, wrens (not too much any more), even miss cooper must be a mrs now because we have now a young cooper stalking the feeders as well.  We are running a creche!<p>

Little Squeaks for 2013<br>
Year 2013 has been a good year for the baby cardinals.  Little Squeaks shown at top though I am afraid did not make it.  SO tiny, he fledged from the nest too early and could not fly.  Maman and papa did their very best to protect it, but the blue jays and other birds were too interested.  Since then our cardinal parents are more experienced and we have at least 6 to 8 little squeakers flying about the garden.<p>

And I am sure there are many more I have not yet been able to photograph.  I know we have little Chickadees and a bebe mockingbird around, but it keeps out of sight near the feeders.<p>
