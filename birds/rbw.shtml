Early in my feeding of the birdies, I added a couple suet feeders.  My idea was to attract the greatest variety of birds by offering the greatest variety of fair at the table.  The suet I considered would attract Downey Woodpeckers which I knew existed in the area and had even seen on occasion in the garden, as well as Chickadees and whatever else might take a fancy to the suet.  For over 6 months the Chickadees took only occasional notice and the local woodpeckers, well, they seemed entirely indifferent to my generous offer.  Thankfully my two warbler friends, the Orange-Crowned and Pine Warblers have taken well to the suet and enjoy a tasty snack without the heavy competition as is found in the seed feeders.  <p>
Finally, after much time, a woodpecker has noticed my effort.  Even then, its first visits were to the seed feeders and then on the ground like any sparrow or dove.  Now it has found, and seems to enjoy the suet on offer.  The Downey's? Well, they seem still to hold the suet in contempt.  Oh, well, Welcome to my new daily friend.<p>

I added a prop to the base of the suet holder so things are a bit more easy for my friend.  If you notice on the photo above, it seems madame is also making her visits for supper.  Hope the prop helps!<p>

Stats on our Red-Bellied Woodpeckers show our friends, never abundant, visit most frequently in summer, no doubt babies to feed and an easy supply to be found.<p>
