Orange Crowned Warblers winter over in this part of the Gulf Coast and this little chap seems to make our garden its homely home.  I find things odd that it enjoys suet and sunflower seeds, I always thought these birds were insect eaters.  Well, live and learn!  Here we see photos of my friend at the suet and seed feeders enjoying itself thoroughly.  Also, one morning while swimming the pool, he fluffed up his feathers allowing a nice glimpse of his little orange crown!

This morning a Pine Warbler stopped by to take a few seeds while my Orange-Crowned friend was eating.  He was VERY upset with the Pine's arrival and let him know!<p>

Garden stats for the Orange Crowned Warbler show a typical signature of a winter migrant.  The birds are relatively abundant (for warblers) and frequent regular visitors over the winter months.  They clear out in April and will not be seen again until late October.<p>
