House Finches (males) are generally a nice red colored bird that are fun to watch at the feedres.  Occasionally I see a yellow pigmented variation, apparently due to something in their diet, or perhaps insufficient diet.  I have read both reasons given.  I find it odd though as I have a flock of house finches including at least two yellow males.  I have to imagine they all share same/similar diets and at my feders at least the yellow chaps are easily as aggressive as any bird there.  Its a mystery...
