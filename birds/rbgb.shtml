I saw my first ever Rose Breasted Grosbeak the morning of 17 April at High Island on the Gulf Coast.  That same evening back home I was pleased and more than a bit surprised that another had found our garden feeders.  This lovely bird is now a regular at the feeders even chasing away the occasional house finch.  Still a bit of tension with the cardinals, but he seems to be accepted.  Well, its only temporary as this bird will continue his migration north to Canada soon enough.  Welcome!
