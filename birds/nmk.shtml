I visited an nice little wooded nature preserve this January and, when leaving I was rewarded with an interesting siting of a small flock of Nutmeg Mannikins.  These birds are breeding exotics recently introduced to the Houston Gulf Coast, Florida, Alabama, and extensively in California.  That is, they are here to stay.  While agreeably interesting to look at, I can't help but wonder at the efferts to establish these exotics given the damage resulting from the introduction of English Sparrows, Starlings, and other non-native birds.  Will we learn?
