OK OK OK, I KNOW, these are the bad guys..  But they are still in the garden and nothing I can do about this.  Actually, aside from the female's creepy behavior as a nest parasite, I have to note that the male is a rather handsome bird.  <p>

Stats for the cowbird tells the story with visit frequency maxing in the spring right when all the nest opportunities are at their best.  Dispersal is early, in July already, not surprising in a species that cannot involve itself in bringing up a family!.<p>
