We have had occasional visits by Baltimore Orioles over the last year but no real good close views or frequent visits.  This spring we began making a better effort to entice the birds with tasty orange halves at the feeder.  For over a month we have kept fresh oranges only to have them spurrned.  We know they are in the vicinity, just the other day a couple turned up to play in the artificial rain, above, (Madame had so much fun getting wet that she needed to really fluff up and dry out after).  <br>Finally today a handsome male came to taste the orange.  We certainly hope it will be to his liking.  If he (and wife) become regulars I am hankering to add an oriole necter feeder.  We see...  <p>

Stats show our Baltimore Orioles to be passage visitors in spring and fall, not hanging through the summer.  More's the pity as these are such magnificant birds.
