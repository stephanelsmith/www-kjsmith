An occasional visitor to the garden, (increasingly frequent in fact) this Cooper's Hawk sits in our oak feeling a bit put out and upset.  Two reasons cause its trouble, in the first case, as can be seen, there is no tasty dinner in its talons, its attack failed yet again.  Worse, now there is the added shame of having a human out taking photos.. Woe....

Ahhh..  Life is better now, a tasty treat! So really.., who cares if that human is out taking photos again?!  <p>

Its January and young miss Cooper stops by the big pool to take a look around, its cold and she would like a treat as much as all the regulars do.  Speaking of all the regulars, where are they???<p>

Another spring, another generation, another baby Cooper stopping by for a drink and, if possible, a fresh meal...<p>

Cooper makes infrequent, but regular visits to the garden all year (with the odd exceptions of April and July, why?).  Always a threat, our little birdies must make numerous daily "Cooper Drills" to maintain readiness.
