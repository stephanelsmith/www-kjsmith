Not your typical garden visitor!  This lovely yellow finch arrived one morning without fanfare at the feeders, just another finch among the cast of 10,000 finches we daily entertain.  I did note that this one was quite yellow, much more so than our usual yellow-plumage house finches which make up some 15% - 20% of our male finch population.  As I looked closer it seemed most unusual and I began to make a few photos.  I simply had never seen such a bright yellow house finch!  I did take time to check out my bird guides and nothing came close other than the house finch variety, (It never occures to me to consider exotics).  <p>  Placing the photos on the Whatbird forum quickly brought the right answer, a Canary!  Well who would have thought!  The poor chap is just trying to make its way alone in a large and unwelcomming world after having escaped from some cage somewhere.  I checked the local petstore and they sell canaries for about $80 each so not only is this bird an escaped fugitive, but it has a price on its head as well!  It did not return the next day so it must be that much further on its underground railroad.  Good luck Mr Canary!
