I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and bald eagles were a part of my birding, not uncommon in the western side of the Cascade Mountains.  This photo was taken on a recent visit to my family in Seattle.  Bald Eagles nest and roost along the piers and docks of Lake Union in central Seattle.  This eagle decided to land on a log just a few 10's of feet from my brother's houseboat and pose for his photo.

A recent (2018) spring visit to Seattle and Lake Union and the eagles are still around.  <p>
