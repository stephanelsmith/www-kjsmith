Life can be hard and sometimes short for any bird in the wild, and this includes those in and around our garden feeders.  In the 6-months that the feeders have been up, I have noted at least 5 hawk attacks, three of them successful.  Well, hawks are birds too.  I must say it does not please my wife that we may be luring some of these friendly colorful birds to their doom.  For me, it is ambivalent as I believe these creatures are at risk the day they are hatched and our feeders give them a better shot than they might otherwise have.  Besides, hawks need a meal too.  We have thus hosted a Cooper's Hawk and a possible Kestrel in the several attacks I have witnessed.  <p>
Addendum as of late January..  It seems that our garden has become a part of the Cooper's hawks' regular circuit.  I have noted attacks now three to four or more times a week.  Most fail, but not all.  The hawk is especially interested in the doves, well, they ARE larger.
