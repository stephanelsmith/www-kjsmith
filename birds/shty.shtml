One of the finches in our little garden flock is this gal who seems to have been born with excessively short tail feathers.  I call her Shorty and keep track to see that things are ok, our little underdog.  Shorty does very well and swims with the others in the pool, elbows in to the feeder and generally behaves as if the short tail is no big deal.  Way to go Shorty!
