Ruby Throated hummingbirds are regular visitors to our garden, the feeder enhancing the territorial value of our place greatly I am certain.  In this photos the lady poses for a few photos while nervously worrying about unwelcome guests at her feeder.  <p>

2 March, our first Ruby-Throat, a female thoughtfully posed for a photo before leaving.  She has not returned.. sigh.. <p>

On 9 March, and nearly daily thereafter, this male has made regular visits to the feeders.  Hard to get a good shot of his lovely ruby gorget, he gets nervous when the big lens is pointed his way.<p>

Posing now for photos, our ruby throat is more concerned about protecting his lovely territory from frequent intruders than the crazy human with the big cyclops eye.<p>

It is September and the youngsters are as big as their parents now.  With the urge to migrate south starting to manifest, it is time to stoke up at the feeders as much as possible.  No possibility to defend territory.<p>

Stats show a summer visitor strangely less frequent in June.  Not sure why, suspect two populations here, those that stick around to nest and those passing through, especially adults and juveniles dispersing southward later in summer to the Gulf Coast in preparation for the real deal south migration.<p>
