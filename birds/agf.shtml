This little traveller showed up at the feeder just before Thanksgiving, flying in with the latest coldfront.  The variety of migrants here in Katy is very interesting but I can't help wishing I could see these chaps in their summer nuptial plumages!  Winter coats are just so dull and uninspiring, and often devilishly difficult to identify!<hr size=15>

Birds can be perverse and not give to your expectations.  About one or two months back I put up this nice nijer thistle feeder just for the pleasure of the goldfinches who were starting to become regulars in the garden.  It hung there ignored and unused that whole time while the goldfinches merrily competed for the sunflower seeds with everyone else.  I finally banished the thistle feeder to a secluded spot and decided no more thistle.  Everything I had read about this being the prefered choice of goldfinches was clearly wrong.  So, today the finches "discovered" the thistle feeder and have been including it in their diet.  Perverse little cretens...<p>

Late January and the times are warm and very springlike.  This little goldfinch is busy working on his summer jacket!<p>
Addendum: In mid-February these lovely creatures became scarce and their last visit was 18 Feb.  I was so hoping they would stay long enough to give me a glimpse of their nuptual finery!

Winter 2012-2013 and our friends are back, pushing and shoving and eating the thistle as quickly as they can.<p>

Stats show yet another winter visitor, well, this IS the Gulf Coast...<p>

Finally, this little chap dons his nuptial plumage before heading off north.  We rarely get to see this (this in fact was the only time).
