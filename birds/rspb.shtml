10,000 pardons for the poor focus but the bird was flying quite high and with manual focus I can only do so well.  Living as we do just off Barker Reservoir in West Houston we are very fortunate for the many fascinating large birds that can be seen flying overhead.  This pink beaut was a special treat!<p><p>

As the seasons turn and spring returns in 2016, I am finding Roseate Spoonbills become somewhat more common.  This gives me additional opportunities to photograph these lovely birds.<p>
