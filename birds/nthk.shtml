Photographing birds as they fly overhead, sometimes quite high, is a thankless task.  Mostly I get blurry images I can barely identify the bird in.  Sometimes better.  <p>

Reslts from two seasons of evening nighthawk watching.  The migration periods are clearly seen in this chart.  Note, I have chosen to indicated in small red dots those evenings where I was making observations but no nighthawks were seen.  This needs to be distinguished from evening where I was not making observations.<p>
