<H3>Opened in the early 1930's, the open pit coal mine at Fushun has been dug into an incredible hole some 6 Km long, 2 wide and nearly 200m deep.  The coal there is high quality and also known for its gem-quality amber. This photo taken on my first visit to China in 1998 shows the coal being dug with tiny shovels (see the modern shovel at Anjaling for compatison). Spontaneous coal fires burn in the distance and my colligue Jert Jan stands in the middle-foreground.<P>
