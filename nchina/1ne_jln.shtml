<H3>The city of Jilin on the Songliao River is the old capitol of Jilin Province.  There each year on the West Mountain Buddhist Temple is a festival which I have the fun to see.  Here a young woman hangs a card with her wishes for a good future (I presume).  This is common practice I learn at festivals in China and as you see in the photo, she is only one of thousands to place her wishes on the wall.<P>
