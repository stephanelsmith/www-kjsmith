<H3>In the coal mining districts southwest of Meihekou they still use steam-powered locomotives to haul coal and spoil from the mines. I find these engins magnificant, large and powerful, the last of a breed.  I imagine in the not too distant future they too will fall victem to the process of modernization. While economically beneficial to the mines, something important will be lost. Still, I cannot wish these mines operate as a museum for my own pleasure.  Its a pity.<P>
