Spring 2020 and, corona virus notwithstanding, it is a great year for our Monarch population.  Since March we have had 3-5, sometimes more monarch's in the garden at any given time.  All the milkweed that we have planted have been doing very well and this winter, while overall quite cold, did not experience a hard freeze.  That means the plants, pollinating plants as well as milkweed never froze down to a stubble.  The plants were green and flowering all winter and through the spring, ready to welcome the returnning monarchs. <p> 
With the good spring and many visiters it is no wonder we have had tons of larve, and then pupae.  I counted what I could find, some 16 chrysalis' at a minimum.  In some milkweed plantings with no handy fence or wall nearby the chrysalis' would be more subtly hidden and away from our prying eyes.  Still, of those I did see we had mostly success in producing adult butterflies.  I cannot know and so cannot comment on how well they did afterwards adn I know some few did die here or there.  But overall I think we have done a good part supporting efforts to strengthen the monarch population.  <p>
The above photos follow one chrysalis through the last couple days.  Enjoy!
