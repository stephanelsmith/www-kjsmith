Field Recording Sourcebook<p>
I upload this as a pdf document because I am just too old and cranky to mess more with the markup needed. I think the pdf is formatted nicely in 9x6 inch format, easily readable. Below is the table of contents to give a good idea of what is inside. For field recordist I believe this is an excellent resource with analysis and charts you will find nowhere else.

<p>

If you wish to craft a setup to record in the field you need to know what is available and what specs actually count. Just looking at spec sheets with a zillion parameters is confusing. So, what is actually important for field recording?  You will be wanting a setup that is SENSITIVE and LOW NOISE. Bird calls can be hard to hear and you will probably be amplifying your recordings, you do not want to amplify much noise along with it. Hopefully this pamphlet will shed some light on the subject with actual facts, data, and analysis.<p>

Finally, it is critically important to SET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. You are likely not going to be submitting your recordings for inclusion is a National Geographic documentary. Even if you have put together a zazu noise-free setup, it will NOT prevent your neighbors from fireing up their gasoline-powered leaf blower right when that rare bird is calling. You live in a noisy environment, deal with it!<p>
