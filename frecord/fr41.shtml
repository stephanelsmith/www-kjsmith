My rant against ball-heads for camera tripods.<p>
</h2><h3>
<img src="fr41b.jpg"><p>

In the "Good Old Days" not so long ago when industry was your "friend" and worked to manufacture products both efficient and useful, virtually ALL camera tripods came with Tilt-Pan heads. Its not hard to see why, that is the most efficient and preferred way to use a tripod. Somewhere along the way a marketer (I presume) asked an engineer to design a solution for a non-existent problem, thus the detestable Ball-Head. <p> 

The ball head is difficult to operate, and it makes leveling the camera very difficult as the head swivels in any direction. Additionally, it supports much less weight than a tilt-pan setup. It is something no photographer would ever want to purchase, much less use. Do not take my word on this. You need only look at the detachable-head tripods for sale on Amazon. Virtually ALL the tripods come with the ball-head. Why? Because there is NO OTHER way to sell the accursed heads. It merely adds to the tripod cost because you must buy a Tilt-Pan head separately. Industry no longer even trys to be your friend. It all aggravates me.<p>

By the way, before you toss the ball-head in the dustbin, remove the plate, it could be useful.<p>

Jan 2025 addendum: <br>
I have discovered a use for the otherwise worthless ball head mount. Remove it from the tripod where it serves no purpose and instead mount it on your tripod accessory bar (3/8” to 1/4” female adapter needed). Then you can attach the quick-remove plate to the back of your sound recorder. This allows you to adjust the recorder angle and easily dismount it from the accessory bar for downloading your recordings into the computer. <p>

NEEWER Video Camera Tripod Pan Tilt Head <p>
$60.00<p>

<img src="fr41c.jpg"><p>

About this item<br>
NEEWER TH03 all metal tripod head features a tilt and pan handle, and effortlessly rotates the camera 360° or tilt it +90°/-60°, ensuring seamless transitions from horizontal to vertical compositions, and stably supports cameras up to 11lb/5kg.<p>

A bowl shaped leveling base enables you to pivot the camera 360° and slightly tilt it between -15° and +15° when precise adjustment is needed. After achieving an ideal angle, tighten the screw knob to keep the camera stationary.<p>

Use the professional pan base to smoothly swivel the camera for panorama photography and videography. 360° scale markings help you revolve the camera with high accuracy and a dial knob can securely lock the camera in place<p>

Arca type quick release system. <p>

[Ed Note: With this tripod head one locks the tilt via a simple rotation of the tilt handle. This is very important as it allows one-handed operation for tilt adjustment. Many/most tripod heads these days feature a "bent" tilt handle that cannot be rotated. Tilt adjustment requires two hands, one to loosen a clamp and the other to change the tilt before then re-tightening the clamp. This is obnoxious and unnecessary and therefore to be avoided in your tripod head choice.]<p>

USB Battery discharge versus time used with my actual setup:<p>

<img src="fr41i.jpg"><p>
The above usage plot (powering an H5 recorder with two condencer microphones) for my battery indicates a 28.5 hour potential, suggesting 32355 mAh total power rather than the stated 38,800 mAh. Still quite respectable.<p>
