</h3><h2>My Experiences with Suburban Background Noise</h2><h3>

Having been recording in my "patch" for some time now, I have experience with the nature of the urban background noise environment. What follows is a summary of the main sources of noise I have to contend with daily. There are two principal types of noise to describe, "Man-made" rumble and "Natural” ambient noise. <p>

</h3><h2>Man-Made noise sources (at my suburban patch) include:</h2><h3>
1)	Garden machinery.<br>
Gasoline-powered lawn mowers, edger’s, and leaf blowers (don’t get me started) can be heard at any time, seven days a week, 12 hours a day, and often are! I have been bothered by lawns being mowed late into evening dusk when night is near.
Tree trim services with their chain saws, shouting, and chipping machines.<p>
2)	Road rumble.<br>
From Interstate 10 to the north or Fry Rd to the west and south.<br>
I bird mornings so I contend with rush-hour road roar generally from before I start to around 9:30 ish at least although loud rumble can float in anytime. <p>
3)	Aircraft.<br>
Commercial jets approaching IAH pass sometimes every few minutes, business jets approaching Hobby can pass low and loud on occasion, and private / small aircraft linger low and loud at anytime, and often do.<p>
4)	Lawn watering system.<p>
5)	Air conditioners/heat pumps.<br>
My own especially!<p>
6)	Shooting range.<br>
Across Barker Reservoir is a shooting range that is active more or less most days, and very active Friday through Sunday. Percussive reports occasionally sound like a war-zone!<p>
7)	Dogs.<br>
Barking is heard from just about anywhere, but especially our neighbors’ little Rødent, Mr. Yappy.  <p>
8)	Nearby construction projects.<br>
Houses get built in the area and roofs get rebuilt. The hammering, sawing, shouting can be heard for miles.<p>
9)	Something new in the neighborhood.. outdoor drum practice! Merde!<p>

</h3><h2>Natural noise sources include:</h2><h3>
1)	Rain and Thunder.<br>
I record most days rain or shine so this can be a problem for which there is no mitigation. There is the sound of the rain itself as well as the sound of it dripping off the roof (I stay under cover!). The sound is across the frequency spectrum and cannot be edited away. Thunder is percussive and loud, but not frequent.<p>
2)	Wind.<br>
Windy days can also have heavy noise across the audio spectrum making recording difficult, but there are “openings” so get out and record!<p>
3)	Bugs.<br>
Bugs in summer, including Katydids, Cicadas, Crickets, etc. are loud and cover same frequencies as many/most birds. Sucs for the recordist.<p>
4)	Frogs.<br>
Frogs croak/call at low frequencies, often more or less continuously in the morning, evening or night. <p>
5)	Birds.<br>
Yes you hear that correctly. With a sensitive mike and a busy environment there can be so many birds calling away that it is very difficult to isolate a single bird to record without interference from other birds.<p>
