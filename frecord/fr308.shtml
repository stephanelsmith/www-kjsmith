</h3><h2>Wildtronics Pro Mono versus Rode NT1</h2><h3>

I have been recording for some time now with a dual-channel Wildtronics / Rode NT1 setup. It was my intention to have the Rode cover the space above, behind, and to the sides of the highly directional dish, zones otherwise “rejected”. On my recordings it always seems surprising to me that the "chatter" on the two tracks are pretty much the same. That is, the dish is recording all the same sounds as the NT1 and at similar amplitudes. Yes, sometimes the dish brought in the sound at superb strength and I know I was in good focus (I do not, can not reposition the dish with every chirp I hear). From many articles I have read I had been led to think of directionality as off-axis rejection. That does not seem to be happening. Now I understand why.<p>

Having constructed polar plots scaled to absolute sensitives when comparing directional microphones, I am struck by the incredible sensitivity of the Wildtronics dish at all polar angles. This should remind the reader that "Directional" in microphones is defined as a ratio between the sensitivity at zero polar angle to that at some large angle, say at 60 or 90 degrees. It is NOT "off axis rejection" although it is often presented as such. <p>

The following plot shows the Wildtronics polar responce for 1000 and 3150 Hz along with the Rode NT1 responce at 1000 and 4000 Hz. All curves are plotted with sensitivities relative to each other. On the chart I have rotated the NT1 120 degrees off the dish zero axis. This reflects my actual setup where the angle between the two microphone zero axes is about 120 degrees. Think of the chart as representing a vertical cut with the NT1 directed up and behind the dish. Note that the Wildtronics data appears “puffed out” due to the scale chosen in this plot. I assure you the data is unchanged and the plot correctly shows the relative amplitudes of the original.<p>

The first and immediate impression is just how much lower the Rode NT1 sensitivity (blue curves) is with respect to the dish (red curves) with its "free gain". The Lewitt LCT 540 S would only be four dB better, still well below the dish sensitivity. My angst about missing the off-axis rarities was misplaced! <p>

On looking at the chart though I am troubled. The curves suggest that the NT1 audio should nowhere be as strong as that from the Wildtronics. As mentionned earlier, that is not always the case. I need to take a moment here to explain more carefully what I am actually hearing. Yes for the most part the chatter is the same or similar with either mic. Often the dish audio is sharper and stronger and it is what I clip much of the time. Still, the NT1 does capture better audio some of the time, and for a certain small amount of time it captures audio where the dish does not, for instance Swifts and Whistling ducs which I know are flying above and/or behind the dish. This is contrary to what the chart is showing, even above and behind the dish it still has greater sensitivity. <p>

So, is the Wildtronics really as sensitive as they report? As things turn out, there is more to know than what I have presented so far. The chart is a base case but it does not reflect totally how the microphones are being used. Specifically, on my setup I level each microphone independantly. The Zoome H5 leveling is made by rotating dials marked 0 to 10. My practice for low ambient recording is to set the NT1 at 9 and the more sensitive dish at 7. Assuming the dials reflect a linear amplification responce, this suggests that I am applying some 28 percent greater amplification to the NT1 signal. The following chart reflects this situation where I have applied a 28% increase to the apparent sensitivity level of the NT1. <p>

In the above chart the NT1 is now at least competing with the dish for the sides and rear. With the lobes comming and going with frequency it should hopefully explain why the NT1 can record sharper stronger signal even where it has similar sensitivities. It explains why both channels record similar chatter despite the directionality of one mic and wide field of the other. It does NOT explain those occasional times when the NT1 captures audio and the dish does not. <p>

In a recent communication with Mr. Rutkoski he explained to me that the Pro Mono sensitivity will have 1 to 4 dB microphone differences between units. Should my dish be say 4 dB less sensitive at the same time then the orange curves will be smaller and the "amplified" NT1 curve will be well outside the dish curve in the region above and behind the dish. This is speculation on my part, my attempt to reconcile what I record each day and what the theoretical curves predict. <p>

This whole business of chatter and the sensitive dish's evident lack of side noise rejection may raise some concern. My original idea of side rejection led me to imagine the dish recording very little until a sound source entered to focal zone. That is, little to no side interference. The dish is so sensitive that it picks up sounds from the sides as well. Should this become an issue or problem there is an easy solution. If you are getting too much side pickup, just turn down the level on the recorder. Problem solved.<p>
