</h3><h2>The ZOOM F3 Handy Recorder</h2><h3>

[Ed note: From all that I have read, specifications to reviews, in addition to my experience with various recorders, THIS recorder is my recommendation, the BEST CHOICE for field recording.]<p>

<IMG align=left SRC="fr23a.jpg">

Forget about clipping, forget about gain, and forget about hassle; just power on the Zoom F3 portable 2-track field recorder and press record to capture clear, distortion-free sound from your external XLR mics in an instant for your next video shoot, interview, or sound design excursion. With two premium mic preamps and 32-bit float technology, the F3 handles the softest and loudest sounds you can throw at it while avoiding distortion, maintaining low-noise performance, and freeing you from the responsibility of adjusting gain. Recordings ruined by clipped converters and poorly set preamps are things of the past.<p>

$289<p>

Automatic Distortion-Free Audio<br>
The F3 utilizes dual A/D converters and 32-bit float recording technology to capture intensely loud signals without clipping the converters and bring in extremely quiet sounds without overwhelming noise, all without requiring any gain adjustment from you. Record with confidence, knowing that you can just connect your microphones and start recording to attain crisp, clear audio.<p>

Dual XLR Mic/Line Inputs<br>
Two balanced mic/line inputs with locking XLR jacks and switchable +48V phantom power make the F3 an ideal match for professional microphones such as handheld dynamics and shotgun condensers as well as line-level feeds from a dedicated field mixer.
