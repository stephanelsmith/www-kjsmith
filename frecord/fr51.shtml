</h3><h2>Zazu Field Recording Recommendation</h2><h3>

Here I present a short recommendation for the potential recordist who has yet to invest in much gear and would like the best possible lowest self-noise and most sensitive setup possible without breaking the budget. <p>

</h3><h2>Recorder:<p>
Get the Zoom F3 Field Recorder, $300.</h2><h3>
	This recorder has extreme low self-noise with an EIN of -127 dB.<br>
	It uses 32 bit floating point A/D so good riddance to pesky level-setting. It has 2 XLR ports that provide phantom power for your condenser mics. As 32 bit is the future of recording, time to go all-in, this is the BEST CHOICE recorder.<p>

</h3><h2>Microphone(s):<br></h2><h3>
For one desiring highly directional recording I recommend:<br>
</h3><h2>1) Wildtronics Pro Mono, $790.</h2><h3>
	This is a 22” parabolic dish mic with extreme low noise (-8 dB) and extreme sensitivity, (-4dB with dish boost). It is rather bulky and you will want a tripod, not for walking in the field unless you are a total masochist. <br>
</h3><h2>Or 2) Røde NTG8, $999.</h2><h3>
	This is a long (22”) shotgun mic with similar directionality to the dish above, but more self noise (8 dB) and high sensitivity (-20), 16 dB less than the dish above. At 2ft long with the XLR cable attached it is bulky for walking. <p>

Depending on your budget there are two wide-view choices:<br>
</h3><h2>3) Røde NT1 Signature, $159.</h2><h3>
	This microphone has a very low EIN of 4 dB and Sensitivity of -32 dB. You will not do better for the price. It is a side-address studio mic, not too large and easily carriable in the field. Cardioid pickup.<br>
</h3><h2>Or 4) Lewitt LCT 540 S, $699.</h2><h3>
Very low EIN of 4 dB and very high sensitivity at -28 dB. Wider pattern than the NT1, this is the TOP CHOICE but rather pricy.<p>

For the indecisive who require a compromise:<br>
</h3><h2>5) Røde NTG5 shotgun, $499.</h2><h3>
	A shorter shotgun (8”), it provides some directionality, has low EIN (10dB) and very high sensitivity (-23.5 dB). Easily portable while walking.<p>

OK, there is your gear. You will also want a tripod and associated mounting gadgets, cables, headphones, and a beefy USB battery. For walking ditch the tripod and just get a small waist pouch to hold the recorder and battery.
