</h3><h2>Wildtronics Pro Mono versus Telinga w/Schoeps CCM 4</h2><h3>
Schoeps CCM4 LG<br>
<img align=left src="fr307c.jpg">
The Schoeps CCM4 is a small diaphragm cardioid microphone featuring a detachable cable and designed for use on singing and speaking voices as well as a wide variety of instruments. It can be used as a spot microphone or for stereo recording with additional mics in coincident, ORTF, or M/S microphone arrangements.<br>
At -37.7 dB it most clearly was never intended for low-volume ambient and bird recording!<p>
Sensitivity:	13 mV/Pa or -37.7 dB<br>
Self Noise:	15 dB<br>
$1858<p>

The image on the left is the polar plot for the Schoeps CCM 4 + MK 4 microphone. Clearly a cardioid pickup pattern, it becomes transformed to that below when facing a 22" Telinga dish.<p>

Telinga Modular<br>
<img align=left src="fr307b.jpg">
Telinga Modular a 22" foldable professional parabolic dish set offering your microphones to be used in mono or PZM stereo configurations. Includes handle with mounting kit, foldable dish, Rycote Telinga OEM basket + OEM windjammer (currently supplied by Radius Windshields) + 2 pcs interchangeable Telinga foam cartridges:<p>

Please note: the Telinga Modular does not include microphone or cable/connectors. It is designed for professionals wishing to use a favorite configuration of own mics in the parabolic dish.<br>
$1099<p>

The image on the left is a polar plot of the Telinga 22" coupled with the Schoeps CCM 4 + MK 4 capsule. It is included in the User Manual of the Telinga Modular microphone. I digitized this plot in order to compare it to the Wildtronics.<p>

The Telinga Modular 22” parabolic dish microphone is a principal competitor / alternative to Wildtronics, therefor I think it best to do a bit of comparison. This is rather difficult as the Telinga is a modular design with a Choose-Your-Own-Microphone concept. As the polar response may be microphone specific as well as dish specific, it is non-unique (or not, keep reading!).  Still, the Telinga Modular manual does publish a polar response chart for the dish coupled with a Schoeps CCM 4 microphone facing the dish. A setup that will put you back some $2957, (B&H kindly offers you the combo at a cool $3308) a lot of coin!<p>

The following polar chart compares the Wildtronics Pro Mono to the Telinga Modular. I retain the standard zero dB at zero degree polar. While Wildtronics does give data to allow me to calculate the absolute sensitivity vs polar angle, this was not available for the Telings/Schoeps configuration. (as they published a polar plot, the actual sensitivity ought to be somewhere unpublished).  <p>

Note also that the Schoeps CCM 4 sensitivity is not that great at -37.7 dB. It does not even make it onto my microphone spec list. (The Røde NT1 S has -32 dB and the Lewitt LCT 540 S has -28 dB). I presume it was chosen because it is an end-address mic suitable for use with the Telinga dish.  <p>

On the following plot I give the curves for 1000 Hz on both dishes, and the Wildtronics at 3150 Hz and the Telinga at 4000 Hz. The two curves at 1000 Hz are pretty much identical in the forward high-gain portion. The difference between 3150 Hz and 4000 Hz is significant (21%) which should explain the somewhat wider field on the Wildtronics curve. I strongly suspect that the two dishes at 4000 Hz would also be nearly the same, and so on up the frequency scale. So, the polar responce apparently is dish geometry specific (depth vs microphone focal distance) but not microphone specific. Here I note that both setups appear to have the same basic geometry, so, same basic polar pattern is expected.

It is a pity that so little technical data is available for the Telinga Modular. No frequency response and no dish gain curves are published. Given the very close similarity of the curves above I imagine the two dishes are the same in other aspects as well, ie: gain and efficiency.  <p>

Can we ever hope to even guess the relative sensitivities of the two dishes?. The Total Sensitivity is the Sensitivity of the microphone boosted by the gain of the 22” dish. Without knowing the microphone sensitivity the actual dish efficiency can only be guessed (and vice versa). Referring to published literature: <em>"Practically, the dish efﬁciency η is in the range of 45% to 70% depending on the material, shape and construction. Here, we have calculated the gain by assuming efﬁciency as 50%."</em> Sawant, O. and Bhowmick, IEEE, Jan 2022.  Sounds good to me, lets assume 50% efficiency and start guessing! <p>

Since Total Sensitivity = Dish gain 50% eff (8.46 dB) plus Microphone sensitivity.<p>

Telinga/Schoeps Total Sensitivity = Dish gain 50% efficiency plus Microphone Sensitivity of -37.7 dB.<br>
Telinga/Schoeps	 1kHz: x= 8.46 dB + -37.7 dB = -29.24 dB <br>
The Telinga system lacks the integrated array microphone and booster disk technology included with the Wildtronics. If the Schoeps microphone really has only -37.7 dB sensitivity then the Telinga/Schoeps combo is going to suffer significantly. <p>

Wildtronics array microphone sensitivity = Total sensitivity minus Dish gain 85% efficiency with booster disk:<br>
Wildtronics 1kHz: x = -4 dB - 13.07 dB = -17.07 dB for the Wildtronics array microphone.<br>
At -17.1 dB thats a credibly sensitive microphone!<p>

My analysis strongly suggests that the Wildtronics setup easily has 25dB greater sensitivity than the Telinga/Schoeps setup while retaining the same directionality. <br> $790 versus $2957, you be the judge.<p>
