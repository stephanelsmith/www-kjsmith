A DISCLAIMER before I get started: Everything on this page is NON-COMMERCIAL and I receive absolutely no compensation of any kind from the manufactures of the gear being reviewed. These are my own observations based on my own research. My recommendations you may take as you wish. <p>

This web page is the result of my odyssey in putting together a field recording setup for recording birds. Along the way I have made 100 zillion blunders and costly mistakes. Since one supposedly learns from their mistakes I have a lot of learnings to share here.<p>

First things: Set your goals!  You will be recording in a noisy ambient setting listening for birds that are not always very loud. You will be wanting as sensitive as setup as possible. You will still be amplifying to some extent your recordings so you want as low noise as possible, no need to amplify that!  Other considerations include what type of microphone (dynamic, ribbon, condenser), what power source, cables etc. Let me simplify things a bit. Condenser microphones are the most sensitive and low noise, that is what you will want. So, lets start.<p>

For your recorder you want LOW NOISE (low EIN), you want phantom power with XLR cabling. <p>

For your microphone you want both high sensitivity (first) and low noise.<p>

These are the parameters to look for and these are the parameters I have compiled on my specification tables. Not all manufactures provide all the specifications desired, or they provide the specs in different units making comparison difficult. For microphone polar plots they may also tinker deceptively with scales, beware!  For my specification tables I have downloaded the spec sheets for every unit listed. For microphones especially I have gone through and calculated missing parameters wherever possible. Mostly I do not list products if the manufacture withholds critical data. I do and must assume that what data that is presented is correct and accurate. <p>

Microphones are a curious device that seem to come in an infinite variety. I am sure there are mics out there that I have not yet discovered, but those I list are certainly the main players on the market today. With so much to choose from it can be a daunting task to peer at every spec sheet to make sense. Polar charts in particular are important but difficult to use. Easy to get a general sense of the pattern, cardioid, hyper-cardioid, etc. Comparing polar charts is very difficult. Extracting quantitative information from charts requires that you digitize the curves, not something everybody wishes to do. I do. <p>

With digital curves it becomes possible to:<br> 
1) display curves of different microphones together for comparison at a common scale, and <br> 
2) calculate and display the curves adjusted for their sensitivity (absolute scaling). <p>
Polar plots comparing microphones with relative sensitivities is truly enlightening. I have not seen this done anywhere else so my analysis and charts are unique, you will not find such anywhere else. I hope that the analyses presented here will be helpful.<p>

A note concerning web advice from forums and "reputable" recording sites. Use them, but beware of them. Forums are interesting and the members are often very knowledgeable. They are proud of their opinions and may express them with confidence way beyond what facts allow. Still, they are a good source for knowing what is generally considered worthy.<p>
"Reputable" sites are another matter. Yes they also give a good idea of what is available. But I suspect most or ALL are in the pockets of the manufactures. They can be deceptive and/or just outright false. Without naming names, just be on your guard and double check every statement you read. <p>

I want this site to be a source of unbiased and critical evaluation. I am non-commercial, receive no compensation and accept no advertising. As I do own some equipment that is being reviewed I must admit some bias, but well earned I hope. As mentioned at the start, I have made costly mistakes. These pages are my attempt to set things right.<p>

Finally, it is critically important here to SET YOUR EXPECTATIONS. You are likely not going to be submitting your recordings for inclusion is a National Geographic documentary. Even if you have put together a zazu noise-free setup, it will NOT prevent your neighbors from fireing up their gasoline-powered leaf blower right when that rare bird is calling. You live in a noisy environment, deal with it!<p>
