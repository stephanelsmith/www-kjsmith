</h3><h2>The EVISTR V508</h2><h3>

[Ed. Note: I include this document because I still use the recorder while on travel. It is small and easily transportable. It captures 1536 bps sound quality with internal memory (expandable) and Li-ion rechargeable battery. It can record .wav files at maximum sampling for up to 12 hours on a single charge. It does a fine job for hand-held recording while walking.]<p>
