</h3><h2>The ZOOM H5 Handy Recorder</h2><h3>

[Ed note: This is my principal recorder, not because it is the best choice (that would be the F3) but because it is what I bought before I did sufficient research and it works quite well. Hard to justify the cost of replacing it myself and impossible to justify it to my wife!.]<p>

Up to 24-bit/96 kHz audio in BWF-compliant WAV or a variety of MP3 formats.<br>
Two mic/line inputs with XLR/TRS combo connectors, each with selectable phantom power and -20 dB pad.<br>
Built-in effects, including low-cut filtering, compression, and limiting.<br>
Auto-record, Pre-record, and Backup-record functions mean that you'll never miss that perfect take.<br>
Multichannel and stereo USB audio interface for PC/Mac/iPad with Loop Back function<br>
Powered by two AA batteries or via USB<br>
About 10 hours of operation with alkaline batteries<p>

$202<p>
