<H2>Some thoughts..on honesty</H2><P>
<h3>
* Honest people do NOT need to (re)define commonly understood terms.  If you have to redefine a term to make a point, the point is probably false.  This is telling the "truth" with the intent to deceive.<p>

* If somebody states "we are all leaders", even if that makes people feel good, he/she has clearly redefined the term leader away from common usage in order to tell a lie.<p>

* The end NEVER justifies the means.  Honest people do not tell lies in order to make people feel good.<p>

* Perceptions are extremely important, they are based on commonly understood, and therefor correct, definitions and usage's of words as well as experience with the speaker.<p>

* If an audience perceives that a speaker has an unspoken agenda, it's usually because the speaker has an unspoken agenda.<p>

* Liars often turn out to be responsibility avoiders as well, therefor it is difficult for liars to be true leaders.<p>

* Honest people are consistent in their actions and beliefs, they have little to hide.  Liars have much to hide which usually leads to inconsistent behavior.<p>

* If people do not trust somebody, you can be sure that that person is not trustworthy.  <p>
