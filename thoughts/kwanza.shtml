<H2>Kwanzaa, an African-American holiday we all can and should embrace.</H2><P>
<hr><h3>
Kwanzaa was created in 1966 by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a professor of African-American History at California State University. The holiday, which begins on December 26th and lasts for seven days, is a uniquely American holiday that pays tribute to the rich cultural roots of Americans of African ancestry. It is not a religious, political or heroic holiday, but rather a cultural one.<p>

The word Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili word "Kwanza," which means "first" or "first fruit." The holiday is based on ancient African harvest festivals which emphasized teamwork and accomplishment.<p>

The Seven Principles of Kwanzaa:<p>
