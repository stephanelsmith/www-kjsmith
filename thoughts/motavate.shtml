<H2>Some thoughts..on motivation.</H2><P>
<h3>
Thinking is easy but the task of writing requires discipline
and effort.<p>

Motivation:<br>
My experience and reading indicates to me that humanity finds
its greatest motivation to work and be productive from several
main directions:<br>
     1.   Survival.<br>  People trying to survive, relying on
          subsistence agriculture or even urban thievery work
          extremely hard in order to provide basic food and
          shelter for themselves and their dependents.  The
          lot of these people is often great misery and
          suffering.<p>
     2.   Profit.<br>    People in a position to receive personal
          profit and comfort from their work tend to expend a
          great effort to continue and increase those
          profits.  It is one of the greatest motivating
          forces.<p>
3. A person who is driven by self pride and self worth accomplishes the world because he is the one who will not stop when the profits run out and continue even when all are full. Those are the thoughts of a friend....... <p>

     The first two cases should be considered as "end-member"
cases and much of the productive motivation for the worlds
population exists somewhere in-between.  It should
nonetheless be clear that for much of the "developing" world
the situation is closer to the first case and that for much
of the "developed" world it is the latter.  I find it curious
therefor that much of the social policy in this century
appears to be directed increasingly away from both end-
members, that is, away from the most basic motivating human
factors.  We are guaranteeing survival at the same time as we
increasingly shut the door to middle-class existence for most
of our population.  Where is the motivation when a person is
given a wage for doing nothing while at the same time he/she
has no access or requirement of even a minimum education that
would make productive employment a possibility?<p>
Working out of self pride and worth already presumes that certain minimum subsistence levels have been attained.  At that point, which is where most of the western world lies at this time, self worth looms large as the dominant motivation.<p>
     Karl Marx outlined a great experiment which was carried
out for a period over 70 years in Soviet Russia.  I feel that
the eventual failure of the system was its specific and
conscious elimination of both end-member motivating forces.<p>


See Maslow, A., 1970, Motivation and Personality. 2nd ed. New
     York, Harper and Row.<p>

Maslow's scale of human needs:<br>
     survival, security, affection, self-esteem, self-
actualization.<p>

I can easily see survival and security as being important
motivators to hard work, affection probably not, self-esteem
and self-actualization (whatever that means) could easily be
motivators to hard work if they are bound up with
profits/wealth and material possessions, (which I think they
usually are).<p>
