Recently I was working on my PC at work and got the idea to take a small video camera I had attached to it and aim the camera at the monitor.  The above picture clearly shows that the PC has become aware of itself and I find that this raises some fascinating philosophical questions.  Is it alive?  Does turning the PC off now constitute a felony?  What is it thinking?  Can it be trusted with all the company confidential documents I have stored on its hard drive?  So many unanswered questions...  Is it alive? You be the judge!
