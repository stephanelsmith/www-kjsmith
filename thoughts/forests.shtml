<H2>Some thoughts..on deforestation</H2><P>
<h3>
     World deforestation is a growing problem and the
solution seems about as intractable as any in the world
today.  I had thought that it was one problem that might lend
itself to rational debate.  The problem is abundantly clear,
the magnitude is such that many areas of the world today are
already largely deforested, (Malayasia, Borneo, etc.).
Although special interests are involved in most nations where
deforestation is a problem, they are usually in the minority
and it would be hoped that the governments would be able to
act in the general interests.  The issues to consider are:<p>
     1.   Special interests.<br>  Often the deforestation is in
          the hands of large land-owners who profit immensely
          from the practice and who by their wealth exert a
          profound influence on the political process of the
          government.<p>
     2.   Jobs.<br>  The timber industry provides jobs in
          otherwise economically depressed countries which in
          turn settles and satisfies an important part of the
          population.<p>
     3.   Land.<br>  Much deforestation is practiced by nations
          seeking to settle huge numbers of landless
          peasants.  Again, the practice is popular as long
          as it provides hope and settlement to a segment of
          the population.<p>

     Usually one would think that these influences are
primarily restricted to "third-world" nations with little
alternatives to create jobs or wealth.  It has always been
"easy" for people in the developed north to criticize the
south for poor environmental practices, we have the wealth
and leisure to take notice.<p>
     I recently got a sense of just how truly intractable the
situation is.  President Clinton, a liberal Democratic
president set his administration the task of resolving the
timber/environmental standoff over the spotted owl in the
pacific northwest of the United States.  The issues are
relatively clear:<p>
     1.   Deforestation is known to be causing severe
          degradation of the environment for native wildlife
          and fisheries.  The spotted owl is merely the tip
          of a much larger problem.<p>
     2.   Jobs are affected in every aspect of the situation
          including the forest industry, fisheries, and
          tourism among others.  Jobs will be lost
          regardless of the solution.<p>
     3.   Special interests and mis-information:  the issues
          are constantly being clouded with debate on
          perceived problems not grounded on facts but which
          elicit strong emotions for one side or another, (for example, concern for the timber needs of the
          housing industry which in fact consumes a tiny
          proportion of the total harvest).<p>

     I was hopeful that Mr. Clinton's administration would
successfully see through the cloud, especially since he and
Mr. Gore the vice-president seem pre-disposed to understand the
environmental issues and consequences of inaction.  I feel
that as a minimum the solution ought to include an immediate
ban on exportation of raw timber from both public and private
lands to Japan, (which primarily uses timber for disposable
concrete molding.)<p>
     The proposed solution, or lack of one as it turns out,
was a triumph for short-sighted policy and special interests.
It immediately becomes apparent that if the United States
cannot solve its own deforestation problem, it certainly
cannot expect to speak with any authority concerning the
world deforestation problem.<p>

     Solution?  Recall that the equation has two sides, both
supply and demand.  It seems impossible to solve the problem
while concentrating on the supply side, that is, to convince
supplier nations to curb cutting and give up the wealth
generated.  Perhaps it might be possible to concentrate on
the fewer nations that consume timber.  Two tracts come to
mind in the effort:<p>
     1.   In a negative sense it might be possible to
          "ostracize" those nations who consume and waste
          timber.  A concentrated effort on the one or two
          largest offenders could dramatically lower demand.<p>
     2.   In a more positive sense it might be feasible to
          study the main uses of timber, (disposable concrete
          molding), and develop environmentally sound and
          hopefully less expensive alternatives.<p>
