<H2>Some thoughts..on Christianity</H2><P>

<H4>The Emperor Constantine, in the year 325 called together an Ecumenical or General Council of the Christian Church.  This council met in the Anatolian city of Nicea and was attended by representatives from every major city of the Christian world, both in the eastern and western provinces of Constantine's Empire.  The following Creed, or statement of Christian belief was issued by the Council.  It therefor represents the common basis of unity for all Christians, it is the only such statement which the Church as a whole has ever received.  All subsequent tinkering is mischief inspired by men of pride who preferred schism before humility.

<h3>
We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible; and in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten of his Father, of the substance of the Father, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance (homoousion, consubstantialem) with the Father. By whom all things were made, both which be in heaven and in earth. Who for us men and for our salvation came down [from heaven] and was incarnate and was made man. He suffered and the third day he rose again, and ascended into heaven. And he shall come again to judge both the quick and the dead. <br>And [we believe] in the Holy Ghost. <br>And whosoever shall say that there was a time when the Son of God was not (en pote hote ouk en), or that before he was begotten he was not, or that he was made of things that were not, or that he is of a different substance or essence [from the Father] or that he is a creature, or subject to change or conversion—all that so say, the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes them.  <p><hr><p>
At the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon in 451 the Creed was modified or rewritten thus:<p>
We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, of all that is, seen and unseen. <br>We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light,  true God from true God, begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father. Through him all things were made. For us and for our salvation he came down from heaven: by the power of the Holy Spirit he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary, and was made man. For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.  On the third day he rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no end. <br>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshipped and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets. <br>We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. <br>Amen.
