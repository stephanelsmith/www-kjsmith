<H3>The sun sets over the West Bank as waves wash the Jordan coast.  As recently as 1962 the level was recorded at -396 meters.  Diversions of the Jordan river for human use has stopped most or all replinishment of the sea and the level stands today at -402 meters. It is the lowest place on earth. <P>
