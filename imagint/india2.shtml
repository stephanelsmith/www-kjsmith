Driving (in my case sitting tight in the back seat) on the "open" road in rural India is an experience not soon forgotten.  I am happy to be here writing this note!  Here you see a jammed up line of heavy lorries, here driving correctly on the left side of the road British style.  We, and many other ahead of us, not patient with the bottleneck have taken to the oncomming lane to move on, forcing that traffic onto the "shoulder" if such can be said.  Lines are painted on roads as a kind of decoration with little function.  Car horns on the other hand are quite useful.  It is my theory that they act as a kind of force shield, protecting the vehicle from contact while the sound is heard. Naturally, with such a useful device the drivers keep their force sheilds on much of the time.
