In the countryside north of Kalkuta much, possibly most work is done with manual labor.  The people here are poor, but at the same time busy and productive.  I never saw idle young men loitering by the side of the road.  It is a hard life just the same and one hopes that living standards may be raised everywhere, not just in the cities.
