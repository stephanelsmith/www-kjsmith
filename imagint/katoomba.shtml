<H3>Gateway to the magnificant Blue Mountains, Katoomba stated its existance as a rock quarry and coal mining town.  As the mineral economic base palyed out in the latter part of the 20th century the town came into its own as a tourist center convienently located in the scenic Blue Mountains west of Sydney.  Katoomba keeps much of its early charm.<P>
