<H3>The Nile River cuts through the Sahara like a black gash against the pale tan of the desert.  Seen from the air one fully understands the life-giving importance of this great river.  I had the opportunity to visit the town of Luxor with its temples, Karnak and Luxor, and to ride across the Nile to visit the Valley of the Kings, Queens, and Nobles.  A felucca is the traditional Mediterranian vessel with its triangle-shaped sail.  This boat was carring either locals or tourists on a day trip on the Nile.<P>
