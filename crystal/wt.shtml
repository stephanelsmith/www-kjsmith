This little gadget is most handy for crunching those local behemoths that always seem to be directing their strongest signals right in your direction.  My wave trap is a bit of a combination of 1) Osterhoudt's QRM coil, 2) a design I found online on Owen Pool's excellent web site, and 3) a bit of my own seeing as how I had some, but not all of the ingredients needed from both traps.  That is, I used what I found in the junk box. <p>
The trap is formed on a stiff cardboard paper core with 1 1/4 inch outside diameter.  On this I drilled holes for winding the tank coil, 110 turns of #30 awg enameled wire.  Both Poole and Osterhoudt recommend #32, but 30 is what I had.  Over this I would a coupling coil, 15 turns space wound of #22 awg enameled wire.  Tuning of the tank is completed with a 410 pF var cap.<p>
Tuning is sharp and deep, it takes a bit of getting used to, but then, schezzam!!!.. problem station gone!  I luv it.<p>
