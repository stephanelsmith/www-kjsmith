Radio hobby in general and certainly crystal radio is a mentored hobby with most practitioners able and willing to help one get started and do well in this hobby.  In my researches for information I have been greatly aided by the many helpful web resources built by this community.  I wish to offer here my sincere thanks for your efforts.  I certainly would not have come as far as I have without this help!  The following list is only partial to the number of sites I visited and if your page is not listed I offer my apologies.  This list represents those sites I found most significant and helpful in terms of 1) Crystal Radio Fundamentals and 2) Set Design Inspiration.<p>

<hr size=5>
Part 1, Fundamentals:, Sites where I spend most of my time.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.xtalman.com/">Lance Borden</a>Borden Radio Company<br>
The start of my adventure, serious crystal radio kits, a seriously fine gentleman.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.bentongue.com/xtalset/xtalset.html">Ben Tongue</a>Crystal Radio Set Systems<br>
Ben Tongue's website contains probably the most detailed and technical discussion available on the engineering behind crystal radio's.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.kennethkuhn.com/students/crystal_radios/">Kenneth A. Kuhn</a>Crystal Radio Engineering <br>
Kenneth Kuhn's excellent pages on the fundamentals and design of crystal radios and all their associated parts, excellently written, accessable to the non-specialist yet precise and clear.  I spent hours studying these documents.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.crystal-radio.eu/">Dick Kleijer</a>crystal-radio.eu<br>
Dick Kleijer's site contains great discussions of theory and the results of numerous experiments with his crystal radios.<p>

<A HREF="http://bellsouthpwp2.net/w/u/wuggy/default.htm">Owen Pool WB4LFH</a>Crystal Radio Resources<br>
Owen Pool's great site with much fundamental background, projects, teaching, contest results and so much more.<p>

<A HREF="http://makearadio.com/crystal/index.php">Dave Schmarder</a>Dave's Homemade Radios, literally 10's of different sets all with interesting features and each a pleasure to look at.  Much technical background and good design ideas can be found as well. I like this page.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.crystalradio.net/">Darryl Boyd</a>Stay Tuned Website: see #58 Crystal Radio Circuits 101<br>
The Stay Tuned Website is probably the site I visit most often of all.  This excellent effort contains an enormous amount of information, vintage plans and projects, Contest Radios, Museums, and more. Download Professor Coyle's coil calculators, you will use them constantly.  This is the only source for MB Sleeper's 101 radio reciving circuits I have found. <p>

<A HREF="http://members.shaw.ca/ve7sl/crystal.html">Steve Mcdonald VE7SL Radio Notebook</a>Crystal Radio DXing<br>
Great site for discussions of DXing with crystal radios and double-tuned design fundamentals.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.skywaves.ar88.net/xtalset102/xtalset102.htm">Alan R. Klase</a>CRYSTAL SET DESIGN 102<br>
Alan Klase's site is chock-a-block full of great work and ideas for interesting sets.  His Design 102 gave me good insights in the various incarnations a crystal radio may take.<p>

<A HREF="http://www.midnightscience.com/index.html">The Xtal Set Society</a>Dedicated to once again building and experimenting with radio electronics<br>
Great source for plans and books, kits and parts.  I joined the society as soon as I finished my Mystery Set.<p>
