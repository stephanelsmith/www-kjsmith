My "Homebrew" rig was conceived as a learning and playing testbed and this is exactly how I am using it.  The breadboard has two 2-gang 450 pF variable capacitors and a single 410 pF.  It has a switched detector stand and germanium diode to rectify signals.  So, this works best for testing coils.  Still, I can plop down a new capacitor if needed and hook it in with jumpers.  I start with an idea and perhaps a new component I wish to test, I get out my book of crystal hookups for something that seems to fit and with that as a guide, I carefully clip together the wires/jumpers, etc to get a working circuit. One of my recent uses for the homebrew was to test some low-inductance coils for HF work.<p>

You see mounted a 3.6 uH more or less coil, 10 turns bare copper 14awg wire, 2in dia and 1.9in long.  I am desperatly seeking programming other than conservative right-wing AM talk shows.  The photo shows a simple test rigging with shortwave successfully being heard, amplified.  Signals are weak and need the help of my handy-dandy radio shack mini-amplifier, but the coils are working!  This is what the test bed is for and encourages me to make a dedicated HF rig<p>
