Introduction:<p>

I have been building and studying crystal radios for some time now and slowly begin to learn a few things about these  marvelous sets.  In this section I begin my exploration of coil, coil quality and that mysterious dimensionless factor,  
Q...  I start by presenting data on coil Q turfed up from web, with many thanks to those who publish their data!   
Secondly I present my own Q measurements on four "typical" coils I have laying about. Lastly I play with some Litz wire  
resistance calculations, just for the pleasure.<p>

<IMG SRC="bar3e.jpg"><p>
My purpose here is to present some facts and data that resulted from my explorations of the web.  I have often  
wondered at what the quality factor of my coils should be and as often realized that I really do not have any  
expectations as to what is possible.  Now, having done some research, I can with some confidence say that this is solved.  
 Coils as used in crystal radio broadcast band reception typically employ coils with Q factors ranging from 100+ (pretty  
lousy) through the several 100's (decent) and on up to 1000 or more for those remarkable Big-Litz wonders ($$$).  Knowing  
the expected (or actual) Q of your coil is important in so far as it impacts the choice of diode to be used in the set.   
On my page of Diode Calibration I present a summary graphic which indicates how the diode Rd value relates to the tank  
parallel resistance Rp.  This Rp in turn is a function of the coil Q.  Schezzam!  So here we are.<p>

In your set construction, with a good effort and good engineering practice one can easily expect to wind a solenoid coil  
in the Q = 200  range without much trouble, even with a cardboard form, sealed, of course.  With various "open" coils,  
spiderweb, basket weave, diamond weave, etc. you may expect to double that.. possibly.  The advantage in open coils  
derives from first the separation between adjacent wire turns which reduces self-capacitance in the coil, and secondly  
from the obvious lack of a form.  All materials used in the coil will have some amount of dielectric losses associated  
with them and the less material used the better.  Air core coils are best in this respect.  I am not here to speak about  
ferrite coils as I have no experience with them.  Frankly, they seem (to me) a bit like cheating.
<p>

The following graph presents data that I have scoured off the web.  My primary sources include Hund and Groot, 1925*, Wes  
Hayward, Dave Schmarder, Ken Khun, Mike Tuggle, Steve Ratzlaff, and Dick Kleijer.  10,000 thanks for those who post their  
data on the web!  This plot gives the Q value as a function of coil Rp (parallel resistance).  In striving for a  
high Q coil, in effect one is eliminating losses and increasing parallel resistance (lowering series resistance) as  
much as possible.  There is more to it of course.  The Q formulas Qu = Rp / 2pifL and Qu = 2pifL / Rs tells us that Q is a function of the coil inductance L and the frequency f of the measurement as well as resistance.  <p>  
All measurements chosen for plotting are made around 1 Mhz and most of the coils are in the L = 200 - 350 uH range.  So,  
despite the formulas, in this plot the coil Rp is the main driver.  From either plot it should be apparent that winding a  
coil with Q = 200 or better should be a no-brainer.  If your coil Q is less, you just aren't trying.  Most coils I have  
found to be in the Qu = 150 - 500 range. At the high end, Q's > 1000 seem to be pretty extreme and these coils are  
expensive.  You better be using big Litz 660/46 and use a basket design (although the two best coils on the plot were  
solenoids, go figure!).  <p>
<IMG SRC="coilq4a.jpg"><p>

For this plot, green, blue, and purple circles are for published unloaded coil Q.  I also post in orange circles an estimate of what the loaded Q presented to the diode (Antenna + Tank) might  
look like.  Loaded Q will always be lower than the unloaded Q by several times.  I have estimated that high-end sets (big  
litz, silver-plated ceramic insulated caps, best wiring practices) may lower the Q by about 2 1/2 times (B Tongue's  
performance set has Q = 700).  At the low end (vintage components, small solid wire coils, taps) the load may lower Q by  
up to 6 times. Ken Khun in his excellent web book states that typical sets at 1Mhz have a loaded Q between 20 and 100, 50  
typical and this is where most of my own data falls with the assumptions previously stated.  I scaled the divisor by Qu  
to produce the above plot but note that this is merely an estimate.  Having an idea of your set's Ql will allow a better selection of the proper diode for  
matching.<p>

<IMG SRC="bar3e.jpg"><p>

All the previous data was from published sources and all are for coil Q measurements made at or near 1MHz.  It is interesting  to look at how Q varies across the tuning range of the coil as well.  Having had a chance to make a few Q measurements  myself recently (Q2 2016) I finally have results to show and discuss, results across the broadcast band.  The following  data and plots result from the technique presented in the section "Coil Q Revisited".  Calibrations for my measurements are based on capacitor Q measurements made on my behalf by Steve Ratzlaff AA7U with his HP Q-meter.  It is worth to note that my capacitor used in these measurements has a low end capacitance of 8 pF, 18 pF and radio frequency.  This allows measurements out to nearly 2.3 MHz.
<p>

<IMG SRC="coilq10.jpg"><p>

The above plot gives unloaded coil Q versus frequency for a set of several crystal set coils I have wound (or purchased in  
the case of the diamond weave).  I have chosen coils with what I had hoped to have a variety of performances, from a big  
litz rope basket coil to a close wound tapped solenoid on cardboard stock from.  I even threw in a couple small-gauge tp-form coils just to see how bad things can get (to offset the Litz as it were). The set includes the following coil  
specs (note, coil photos at end of this section):<br>
<IMG SRC="coilq12.jpg"><p>

On the plot itself I post the measured data points and add a best-fit regression and formula describing the relation for  
each coil.  Note that in most cases the regressions have fits with 0.99 or above except the litz coil with 0.88 and the 3.2" tapped solenoid with 0.98.  Additionally I have added in grey a few lines of equal parallel resistance (for L=220 uH).  These allow a  visualization of how the coil Q relates to Rp according to the function Qu = Rp / 2pifL. <p>

The graph clearly shows the litz coil with superior performance, the solenoid and DCC basket coils have similar  
moderate-low performance and the poor diamond-weave coil lies at the bottom.  For the litz coil (light blue dots) and solenoid  coil (red dots) we see a good curve with Q peaking in the middle of the band.  With the silver-plated teflon insulated coil I originally had very high hopes.  This wire does perform above average, but for its high price one would do well just to use big Litz.  The diamond weave coil (purple dots)  appears to be peaking near the top of the band.  The curve for the DCC basket is interesting in that its Q peaks near the top of the band. The wire for this coil I bought on ebay and was  disappointed when it arrived.  While it has an absolutely beautiful green covering, the wire itself is small gauge,  about 26awg and worse appeared to be plated.  At first I assumed the plating was tin to protect the wire from corrosion.   Because of skin effect the current in the wire concentrated on the outer wire surface at radio frequency.  Therefore a  plating can increase the resistance and losses.  I find from my measurements that this wire in fact performs quite well  and am currently assuming the plating is silver. <p>

The general vision of a BCB coil with unloaded Q peaking in the middle of the band is instructive.  Again I remind that  
the published data I have presented in the first part above is for 1MHz, near the "typical" peak Q.  The coil Q's will  
certainly drop in the lower frequencies and possibly in the high as well.<p>

Now a look at the coil Rp<br>
<IMG SRC="qvsrp2.jpg"><p>
For a look at Rp I turn again to my favorite Q versus Rp plot.  Tank Rp is the essential parameter one wishes to know for the purpose of matching tank to diode and load.  Plot display and colors are as before and I have included some lines of constant frequency for the case of L = 220 uH, a pretty normal coil.  This plot illustrates that, for any single coil, Rp is not constant across the entire broadcast band although at higher frequencies (above 2 MHz) some coils have a tendancy towards constant Rp.  No single diode will be matched across the band for a single coil and Rp differences between different coils can be dramatic.  Diode matching MUST be coil-specific.  It seems good practice to choose your diode for a partictular coil at about f = 1MHz.  Note that in this plot I give unloaded coil Q.  When you load the coil with the capacitor, diode, antenna, and audio the Q (and therefore Rp) will drop somewhere between 2.5 to 6 times.  I have attempted to illustrate this in my first "Coil Q vs Rp" plot at the beginning of the page.

A Calculation of 660-46 wire resistance in a high-end coil:<p>
As much of the resistive loss is in the coil, keeping this to a minimum is important.  The following discussion provides  
a few calculations on Litz wire AC resistance.  NOTE: THE ULTIMATE LIMIT ON COIL Q IS THE NEED TO USE WIRE!<br>
From different Litz wire manufacturing sites one can find tables and data allowing the calculation of the resistance of  
your favorite litz wire.<p>

The formula for the D.C. resistance of any Litz construction is:<p>

Rdc = Rs (1.0515)^Nb * (1.025)^Nc  /  Ns<p>

Where: <br>
Rdc =  Resistance in Ohms/1000 ft.<br>
Rs = Maximum D.C. resistance of the individual strands (4544 for 46awg wire)<br>
Nb = Number of Bunching operations (assume = 2)<br>
Nc = Number of Cabling operations (assume = 1)<br>
Ns = Number of individual strands (assume = 660)<p>

Rdc = 4544 (1.015)^2 (1.025)^1 / 660  = 7.27 ohms / 1000 ft.<p>


The ratio of AC resistance to DC resistance of any Litz construction is:<p>

Rac/Rdc = S + K (N Di / Do)^2 * G<p>

Where:<br>
S = Resistance ratio of individual strands when isolated (1.0003 for 46awg wire)<br>
G = Eddy Current basis factor =  (Di * sqrt(f) / 10.44)^4 <br>
F = Operating Frequency in HZ  (assume 1MHz)<br>
N = Number of strands in the cable = 660<br>
Di = Diameter of the individual strands over the copper in inches  = 0.0016<br>
Do = Diameter of the finished cable over the strands in inches = 0.056<br>
K = Constant depending on the number of strands = 2<p>

Rac/Rdc = 	1.0003 +2(660*0.0016 / 0.056)^2 * (0.0016*1000 / 10.44)^4 = 1.393<p>

Therefore the AC Resistance of 660/46 litz wire is approximately :<p>

The A.C. resistance is: 1.39 * 7.27 = 10.13 ohms/1000ft. <p>

An example in real life:<p>

For 53ft of Litz wire to wind a coil:<br>
Rac = 53 * 10.13 ohm/1000ft<br>
Rac = 0.54 ohms<p>

For Qu = 2pifL / Rs<br>
at 1 MHz and L = 230 uH<p>
Qu = 2pi * 1 * 230 / 0.54ohms<br>
Qu = 2692<p>

A 5inch diameter basket weave coil made from 660/46 Litz wire having an inductance of 230 uH will typically require some  
40 turns or about 53ft of wire.  At 10.13 Ohm/kft, that comes to an AC wire resistance of 0.53 ohms for the coil alone.  
Were all the losses represented by series resistance of the wire, the coil would have, at 1 MHz an unloaded Q = 2700!   
This is as good as things can get.  Naturally, wire resistance is not the only source of loss in the tank.  There is a capacitor, metallic objects intruding into the magnetic field of the coil, dielectric losses, eddy current and other losses.  Its no wonder that the best coils just top out just above Q = 1000 or so.  <p>

Time to get measuring.  Below I provide my input data, have at it!  <p>

*Note that in 1925 the importance of coil Rs was understood, but the factor Q was apparently not used.  I have taken  
(quite painfully) the L and Rs data from the Hund and Groot plots and calculated the resulting Q.  I recommend to those interested to download the pdf of their paper.<br>
