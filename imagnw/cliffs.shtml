<H3>Much of Washington state east of the Cascades consists of semi-arid steppe.  Along most stretches of the Columbia river in this region you may find stark cliffs of black basalt which flowed out across the basin as a molten lake just a few million years ago.  Cold today, this bedrock provides the excellent fertility for the many crops produced in the state.<P>
